description:
  This search is used to build a Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) model
  to characterize the length of the command lines observed for each user in the environment.
  By default, the search uses the last 30 days of data to build the model. The model
  created by this search is then used in the corresponding detection search, which
  identifies outliers in the length of the command line.
search:
  '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as start_time
  max(_time) as end_time FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes by Processes.user Processes.dest
  Processes.process_name Processes.process | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | search
  user!=unknown | `security_content_ctime(start_time)`| `security_content_ctime(end_time)`|
  eval processlen=len(process) | fit DensityFunction processlen by user into cmdline_pdfmodel'
how_to_implement:
  You must be ingesting endpoint data and populating the Endpoint
  data model. In addition, you must have the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version
  >= 4.2 installed, along with any required dependencies. Depending on the number
  of users in your environment, you may also need to adjust the value for max_inputs
  in the MLTK settings for the DensityFunction algorithm, then ensure that the search
  completes in a reasonable timeframe. By default, the search builds the model using
  the past 30 days of data. You can modify the search window to build the model over
  a longer period of time, which may give you better results. You may also want to
  periodically re-run this search to rebuild the model with the latest data. More
  information on the algorithm used in the search can be found at
