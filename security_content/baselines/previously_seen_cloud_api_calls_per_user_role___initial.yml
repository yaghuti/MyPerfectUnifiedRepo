description: This search builds a table of the first and last times seen for every
  user role and command combination. This is broadly defined as any event that runs
  or creates something. This table is then cached.
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTimeSeen, latest(_time) as lastTimeSeen
  from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.user_type=AssumedRole AND All_Changes.status=success
  by All_Changes.user, All_Changes.command | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")`
  | eventstats min(firstTimeSeen) as globalFirstTime | eval enough_data = if(globalFirstTime
  <= relative_time(now(), "-7d@d"), 1, 0) | table user, command, firstTimeSeen, lastTimeSeen,
  enough_data | outputlookup previously_seen_cloud_api_calls_per_user_role'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider.
