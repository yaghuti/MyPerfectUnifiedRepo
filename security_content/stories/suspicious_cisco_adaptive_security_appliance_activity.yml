description: |
  This analytic story provides a suite of detections built to analyze telemetry and syslog
  generated by Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) devices.
  It focuses on identifying suspicious and potentially malicious activity such as logging
  suppression, unauthorized configuration changes, anomalous connection patterns, unexpected
  drops in core syslog message volume, and potential command-and-control (C2) behaviors.
  These detections help defenders surface behavior on security edge devices that may indicate
  defense evasion, exploitation attempts, or device tampering.
narrative: |
  Cisco ASA/FTD appliances are commonly deployed at network boundaries to enforce security
  policies, inspect traffic, and provide remote access. As critical control-plane devices,
  their logs and operational telemetry can reveal adversary behavior ranging from configuration
  tampering and logging suppression to exploitation and C2.

  Monitoring activity from Cisco ASA and FTD devices is critical because these appliances serve as key security controls at the network perimeter. Analyzing their telemetry and syslog data helps organizations maintain visibility into device health, policy enforcement, and potential threats. Regular monitoring enables early detection of unusual or unauthorized activity, supports compliance requirements, and strengthens the overall security posture by ensuring that any deviations from expected behavior are promptly investigated.
