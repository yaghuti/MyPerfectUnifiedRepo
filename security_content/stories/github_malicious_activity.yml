description: Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate suspicious GitHub activities
  that might indicate malicious behavior, including pull requests from unknown users, disabled security
  workflows, and other potentially harmful repository modifications. These detections help identify
  attempts to compromise repositories through unauthorized code changes, bypassed security controls,
  and other suspicious actions that could lead to supply chain attacks or data breaches.
narrative: GitHub is a popular platform for developers to collaborate on code and manage projects.
  However, it can also be used by malicious actors to conduct various types of attacks, including
  supply chain attacks, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
