description: Fortify your insider threat monitoring with searches that monitor for and help you 
  investigate possible remote employment fraud.
narrative: Remote employment fraud involves threat actors posing as job seekers or employers to 
  gain unauthorized access to organizations, often using fake or stolen identities. This can result 
  in insider threats, data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage, as attackers exploit 
  remote onboarding processes to infiltrate systems or harvest sensitive information. Strong 
  identity verification, background checks, and ongoing monitoring are critical to mitigating 
  these risks.
