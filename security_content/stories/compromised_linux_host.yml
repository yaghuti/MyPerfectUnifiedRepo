description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with Compromised Linux Host attacks. 
  These include unauthorized access attempts, unusual network traffic patterns, and the presence of 
  unknown or suspicious processes. Look for unexpected changes in system files, modifications to configuration files, 
  and the installation of unrecognized software. Pay attention to abnormal resource usage, such as high CPU or memory 
  consumption. Regularly review logs for signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement, and ensure integrity checks 
  are in place to detect tampering with critical system components.
narrative: In a tale of digital intrusion, Imagine a system administrator noticing unexpected spikes in network traffic and CPU usage. 
  Delving deeper, they find unknown processes running and unfamiliar software installed. System files and configurations show 
  unauthorized modifications, hinting at privilege escalation. Log reviews reveal attempts at lateral movement across the network. 
  The administrator's vigilance, combined with regular integrity checks, helps uncover and mitigate the threat. This narrative 
  underscores the importance of monitoring and swift action in maintaining a secure Linux environment.
