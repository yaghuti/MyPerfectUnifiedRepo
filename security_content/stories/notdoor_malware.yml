description: NotDoor is an Outlook backdoor associated with APT28 who is known for breaching 
  organizations across multiple sectors in NATO member states. This analytical story harnesses 
  targeted search methodologies to uncover and investigate activities that could be indicative
  of NotDoor's presence. These activities include tracking file write operations for dropped macros, 
  scrutinizing registry modifications aimed at establishing persistence mechanisms, 
  monitoring suspicious processes, and other malicious actions.
narrative: APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, blends stealth and expertise in its cyber operations. Affiliated with Russia's GRU, 
  their latest campaign involved the malware, named NotDoor for its use of the term “Nothing” in its code, which is implemented
  as a VBA macro for Outlook. It monitors incoming emails for a predefined trigger word, and upon detection, allows attackers
  to exfiltrate data, upload files, and execute commands on the compromised system.
