  This story tracks GhostRedirector, a China‑aligned threat actor that compromises
  Windows servers and abuses IIS to deliver SEO fraud alongside a passive C++
  backdoor. The actor leverages web application flaws, most notably SQL injection,
  to execute PowerShell via sqlserver.exe and retrieve tooling from a shared
  staging infrastructure. Persistence and server‑side manipulation are achieved by
  installing a native IIS module, while command execution and basic backdoor
  capabilities are provided by the Rungan implant. Tooling, including privilege
  escalation components, is frequently staged in ProgramData paths and may be
  obfuscated or signed to evade controls.
narrative: |
  Following initial access through exploitation of public‑facing applications,
  GhostRedirector issues PowerShell and CertUtil downloads from 868id[.]com to
  place binaries under C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\DRM\\log. A malicious native IIS
  module (Gamshen) is registered so that w3wp.exe can selectively manipulate
  responses for search engine crawlers, enabling SEO fraud. In parallel, the group
  deploys the Rungan backdoor to execute commands over HTTP. Privilege escalation
  relies on public "Potato" techniques (for example EfsPotato and BadPotato) to
  create or modify local administrator accounts as fallback access. Observed tradecraft
  includes obfuscation with .NET Reactor, AES‑based string decryption, and occasional
  use of code‑signed binaries. The combined behaviors present multiple detection
  opportunities across IIS module installation and loading, webserver‑spawned
  shells, SQL Server xp_cmdshell abuse, privileged account creation, and unusual
  file staging or download activity in ProgramData.
