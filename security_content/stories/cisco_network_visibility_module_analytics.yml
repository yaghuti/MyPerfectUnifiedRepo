description: |
  This analytic story provides a suite of detections built to analyze endpoint-based network telemetry captured by the Cisco Network Visibility Module (NVM).
  It focuses on identifying suspicious and potentially malicious activity such as process injection, unauthorized downloads, network connections by non-network-aware processes, and potential command-and-control (C2) behavior, etc.
  Leveraging the rich metadata from NVM, including process names, command-line arguments, user context, and module information, these detections provide high-fidelity insights into host behavior and outbound network activity.
narrative: |
  Cisco Network Visibility Module (NVM), part of Cisco Secure Client (formerly AnyConnect), collects granular telemetry directly from endpoints to provide enhanced visibility into process-level network activity.
  This includes detailed fields such as process names, parent-child relationships, command-line arguments, loaded modules, user accounts, and DNS destinations.
  This analytic story leverages that context to detect threats across various tactics and techniques including Command and Control, Execution, Defense Evasion, and Credential Access.
  It is particularly useful for detecting living-off-the-land (LOLBins) behavior, abuse of legitimate system processes, or exfiltration attempts from otherwise trusted binaries.
