description: The following analytic detects the addition of new service principal
  accounts in O365 tenants. It leverages data from the `o365_management_activity`
  dataset, specifically monitoring for operations related to adding or creating service
  principals. This activity is significant because attackers can exploit service principals
  to gain unauthorized access and perform malicious actions within an organization's
  environment. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to interact with
  APIs, access resources, and execute operations on behalf of the organization, potentially
  leading to data breaches or further compromise.
data_source:
- O365
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=AzureActiveDirectory Operation="*Add service principal*" OR (Operation = "*principal*" AND action = "created") 
  | fillnull 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user src vendor_account vendor_product

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `o365_added_service_principal_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: The creation of a new Federation is not necessarily malicious,
  however these events need to be followed closely, as it may indicate federated credential
  abuse or backdoor via federated identities at a different cloud provider.
