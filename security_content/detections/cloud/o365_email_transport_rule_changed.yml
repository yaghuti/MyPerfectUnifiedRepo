description: The following analytic identifies when a user with sufficient access to Exchange Online alters the mail flow/transport rule configuration of the organization. Transport rules are a set of rules that can be used by attackers to modify or delete emails based on specific conditions, this activity could indicate an attacker hiding or exfiltrated data.

  | eval object_name = case('Parameters{}.Name'=="Name",mvindex('Parameters{}.Value',mvfind('Parameters{}.Name',"^Name$")),true(),ObjectId), object_id = case('Parameters{}.Name'=="Identity",mvindex('Parameters{}.Value',mvfind('Parameters{}.Name',"^Identity$")),true(),Id)
  | stats values(object_name) as object_name, min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime, count by object_id, UserId, Operation, signature
  | rename UserId as user

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `o365_email_transport_rule_changed_filter`
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Legitimate administrative changes for business needs.
