description:
  The following analytic detects Google Drive or Google Docs files shared
  externally from an internal domain. It leverages GSuite Drive logs, extracting and
  comparing the source and destination email domains to identify external sharing.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate potential data exfiltration by an
  attacker or insider. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access
  to sensitive information, data leakage, and potential compliance violations. Monitoring
  this behavior helps in early detection and mitigation of data breaches.
data_source:
  - G Suite Drive

  `gsuite_drive` NOT (email IN("", "null"))

  | rex field=owner "[^@]+@(?<src_domain>[^@]+)"

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc. In order
  for the search to work for your environment, please edit the query to use your company
  specific email domain instead of `internal_test_email.com`.
known_false_positives:
  network admin or normal user may share files to customer and
  external team.
