description: The following analytic detects when branch rules are deleted in GitHub Enterprise. 
  The detection monitors GitHub Enterprise audit logs for branch rule deletion events by tracking actor details, repository information, 
  and associated metadata. For a SOC, identifying deleted branch rules is critical as it could indicate attempts to bypass code review requirements 
  and security controls. Branch deletion rules are essential security controls that enforce code review, prevent force pushes, and maintain code quality. 
  Disabling these protections could allow malicious actors to directly push unauthorized code changes or backdoors to protected branches. The impact of 
  disabled branch protection includes potential code tampering, bypass of security reviews, introduction of vulnerabilities or malicious code, and compromise 
  of software supply chain integrity. This activity could be part of a larger attack chain where an adversary first disables security controls before attempting 
  to inject malicious code.

how_to_implement: You must ingest GitHub Enterprise logs using Audit log streaming as described in this documentation https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-splunk using a Splunk HTTP Event Collector.
