description: The following analytic detects the addition of a new owner to a Service
  Principal within an Azure AD tenant. It leverages Azure Active Directory events
  from the AuditLog log category to identify this activity. This behavior is significant
  because Service Principals do not support multi-factor authentication or conditional
  access policies, making them a target for adversaries seeking persistence or privilege
  escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to maintain
  access to the Azure AD environment with single-factor authentication, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access and control over critical resources.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLog log category.
known_false_positives: Administrator may legitimately add new owners for Service Principals.
  Filter as needed.
