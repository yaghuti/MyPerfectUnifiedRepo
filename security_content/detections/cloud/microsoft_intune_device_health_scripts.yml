  The Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services add-on is required to ingest In-Tune audit logs via Azure EventHub. 
  To configure this logging, visit Intune > Tenant administration > Diagnostic settings > Add diagnostic settings & send events to the activity audit event hub. 
  Deploy as a risk based alerting rule for quick deployment or perform baselining & tune accordingly.
