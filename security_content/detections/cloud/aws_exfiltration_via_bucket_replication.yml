description: The following analytic detects API calls to enable S3 bucket replication
  services. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify `PutBucketReplication` events,
  focusing on fields like `bucketName`, `ReplicationConfiguration.Rule.Destination.Bucket`,
  and user details. This activity is significant as it can indicate unauthorized data
  replication, potentially leading to data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, attackers
  could replicate sensitive data to external accounts, leading to data breaches and
  compliance violations.
search: '`cloudtrail`  eventName = PutBucketReplication eventSource = s3.amazonaws.com
  | rename user_name as user, requestParameters.ReplicationConfiguration.Rule.Destination.Bucket as bucket_name
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product bucket_name
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_exfiltration_via_bucket_replication_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately implemented
  data replication to ensure data availability and improve data protection/backup
  strategies.
