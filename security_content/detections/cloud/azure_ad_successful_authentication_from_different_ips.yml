name: Azure AD Successful Authentication From Different Ips

description: The following analytic detects an Azure AD account successfully authenticating
  from multiple unique IP addresses within a 30-minute window. It leverages Azure
  AD SignInLogs to identify instances where the same user logs in from different IPs
  in a short time frame. This behavior is significant as it may indicate compromised
  credentials being used by an adversary, potentially following a phishing attack.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow unauthorized access to corporate
  resources, leading to data breaches or further exploitation within the network.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different
  Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed
  and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
