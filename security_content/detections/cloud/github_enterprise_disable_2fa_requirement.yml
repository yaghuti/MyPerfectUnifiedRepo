description: The following analytic detects when two-factor authentication (2FA) requirements are disabled in GitHub Enterprise. 
  The detection monitors GitHub Enterprise audit logs for 2FA requirement changes by tracking actor details, organization information, 
  and associated metadata. For a SOC, identifying disabled 2FA requirements is critical as it could indicate attempts to weaken 
  account security controls. Two-factor authentication is a fundamental security control that helps prevent unauthorized access even if 
  passwords are compromised. Disabling 2FA requirements could allow attackers to more easily compromise accounts through password-based attacks. 
  The impact of disabled 2FA includes increased risk of account takeover, potential access to sensitive code and intellectual property, and 
  compromise of the software supply chain. This activity could be part of a larger attack chain where an adversary first disables 
  security controls before attempting broader account compromises.

how_to_implement: You must ingest GitHub Enterprise logs using Audit log streaming as described in this documentation https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-splunk using a Splunk HTTP Event Collector.
