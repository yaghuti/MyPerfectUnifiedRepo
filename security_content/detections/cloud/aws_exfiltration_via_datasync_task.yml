- AWS CloudTrail CreateTask
description: The following analytic detects the creation of an AWS DataSync task,
  which could indicate potential data exfiltration. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs
  to identify the `CreateTask` event from the DataSync service. This activity is significant
  because attackers can misuse DataSync to transfer sensitive data from a private
  AWS location to a public one, leading to data compromise. If confirmed malicious,
  this could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information, causing severe
  data breaches and compliance violations.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = CreateTask eventSource="datasync.amazonaws.com"
  | rename  requestParameters.*  as *  
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product destinationLocationArn sourceLocationArn
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_exfiltration_via_datasync_task_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS Administrator has legitimately created
  this task for creating backup. Please check the `sourceLocationArn` and `destinationLocationArn`
  of this task
