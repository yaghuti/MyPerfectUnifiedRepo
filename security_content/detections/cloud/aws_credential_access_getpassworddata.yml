description: The following analytic identifies more than 10 GetPasswordData API calls
  within a 5-minute window in your AWS account. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to
  detect this activity by counting the distinct instance IDs accessed. This behavior
  is significant as it may indicate an attempt to retrieve encrypted administrator
  passwords for running Windows instances, which is a critical security concern. If
  confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access to administrative
  credentials, potentially leading to full control over the affected instances and
  further compromise of the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail GetPasswordData
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=GetPasswordData eventSource = ec2.amazonaws.com 
  | bin _time span=5m 
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(requestParameters.instanceId) as distinct_instance_ids by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product
  |  where distinct_instance_ids > 10 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `aws_credential_access_getpassworddata_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs. We encourage the users to adjust the values
  of `distinct_instance_ids` and tweak the `span` value according to their environment.
known_false_positives: Administrator tooling or automated scripts may make these calls
  but it is highly unlikely to make several calls in a short period of time.
