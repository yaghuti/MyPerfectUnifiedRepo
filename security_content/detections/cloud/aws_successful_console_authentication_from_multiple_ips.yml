description: The following analytic detects an AWS account successfully authenticating
  from multiple unique IP addresses within a 5-minute window. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs, specifically monitoring `ConsoleLogin` events and counting distinct source
  IPs. This behavior is significant as it may indicate compromised credentials, potentially
  from a phishing attack, being used concurrently by an adversary and a legitimate
  user. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow unauthorized access to corporate
  resources, leading to data breaches or further exploitation within the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = ConsoleLogin 
  | bin span=5m _time 
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats  dc(src) as distinct_ip_count values(src) as src values(user_agent) as user_agent values(dest) as dest by _time, user, signature, vendor_account, vendor_region, vendor_product
  | where distinct_ip_count>1 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_successful_console_authentication_from_multiple_ips_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works when AWS CloudTrail events are normalized use the Authentication datamodel.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different
  Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed
  and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
