- AWS CloudTrail PutBucketVersioning
description: The following analytic detects when AWS S3 bucket versioning is suspended
  by a user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify `PutBucketVersioning` events
  with the `VersioningConfiguration.Status` set to `Suspended`. This activity is significant
  because disabling versioning can prevent recovery of deleted or modified data, which
  is a common tactic in ransomware attacks. If confirmed malicious, this action could
  lead to data loss and hinder recovery efforts, severely impacting data integrity
  and availability.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName= PutBucketVersioning "requestParameters.VersioningConfiguration.Status"=Suspended
  | rename user_name as user, requestParameters.bucketName as bucket_name
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product bucket_name
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_disable_bucket_versioning_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS Administrator has legitimately disabled
  versioning on certain buckets to avoid costs.
