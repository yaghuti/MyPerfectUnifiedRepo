description: The following analytic detects the creation of AWS Network Access Control
  Lists (ACLs) with all ports open to a specified CIDR. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  events, specifically monitoring for `CreateNetworkAclEntry` or `ReplaceNetworkAclEntry`
  actions with rules allowing all traffic. This activity is significant because it
  can expose the network to unauthorized access, increasing the risk of data breaches
  and other malicious activities. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could exploit
  this misconfiguration to gain unrestricted access to the network, potentially leading
  to data exfiltration, service disruption, or further compromise of the AWS environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: It's possible that an admin has created this ACL with all ports open for some legitimate purpose however, this should be scoped and not allowed in production environment.
