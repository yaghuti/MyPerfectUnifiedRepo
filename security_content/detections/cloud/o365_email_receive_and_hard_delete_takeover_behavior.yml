type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies when an O365 email recipient receives and then deletes emails related to password or banking/payroll changes within a short period. This behavior may indicate a compromised account where the threat actor is attempting to redirect the victims payroll to an attacker controlled bank account.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events AND Message Trace events.
known_false_positives: Possible new user/account onboarding processes.
