description: The following analytic identifies failed authentication attempts against
  an Azure AD tenant during the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) challenge, specifically
  flagged by error code 500121. It leverages Azure AD SignInLogs to detect these events.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to authenticate
  using compromised credentials on an account with MFA enabled. If confirmed malicious,
  this could suggest an ongoing effort to bypass MFA protections, potentially leading
  to unauthorized access and further compromise of the affected account.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: "False positives have been minimized by removing attempts that
  result in 'MFA successfully completed messages', which were found to be generated
  when a user opts to use a different MFA method than the default.\nFurther reductions
  in finding events can be achieved through filtering 'MFA denied; duplicate authentication
  attempt' messages within the auth_msg field, as they could arguably be considered
  as false positives."
