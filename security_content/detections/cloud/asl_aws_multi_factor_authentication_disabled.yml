description: The following analytic detects attempts to disable multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) for an AWS IAM user. It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs, specifically
  monitoring for `DeleteVirtualMFADevice` or `DeactivateMFADevice` API operations.
  This activity is significant as disabling MFA can indicate an adversary attempting
  to weaken account security to maintain persistence using a compromised account.
  If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to retain access to the
  AWS environment without detection, potentially leading to unauthorized access to
  sensitive resources and prolonged compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: AWS Administrators may disable MFA but it is highly unlikely for this event to occur without prior notice to the company
