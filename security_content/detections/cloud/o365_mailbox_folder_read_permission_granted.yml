description: The following analytic identifies instances where read permissions are
  granted to mailbox folders within an Office 365 environment. It detects this activity
  by monitoring the `o365_management_activity` data source for the `Set-MailboxFolderPermission`
  and `Add-MailboxFolderPermission` operations. This behavior is significant as it
  may indicate unauthorized access or changes to mailbox folder permissions, potentially
  exposing sensitive email content. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain
  unauthorized access to read email communications, leading to data breaches or information
  leakage.
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=Exchange (Operation="Set-MailboxFolderPermission" OR Operation="Add-MailboxFolderPermission" ) 
  | eval isReadRole=if(match(AccessRights,"^(ReadItems|Author|NonEditingAuthor|Owner|PublishingAuthor|Reviewer)$"), "true", "false") 
  | search isReadRole="true"

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `o365_mailbox_folder_read_permission_granted_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Mailbox folder permissions may be configured for legitimate
  purposes, filter as needed.
