description: The following analytic detects an AWS CloudTrail event where a user with
  permissions updates the login profile of another user. It leverages CloudTrail logs
  to identify instances where the user making the change is different from the user
  whose profile is being updated. This activity is significant because it can indicate
  privilege escalation attempts, where an attacker uses a compromised account to gain
  higher privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could allow the attacker to escalate
  their privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over sensitive
  resources within the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail UpdateLoginProfile
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = UpdateLoginProfile userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com
  errorCode = success | eval match=if(match(userIdentity.userName,requestParameters.userName),
  1,0) | search match=0 
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_updateloginprofile_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created keys for another user.
