name: Azure AD High Number Of Failed Authentications For User

description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account experiencing more
  than 20 failed authentication attempts within a 10-minute window. This detection
  leverages Azure SignInLogs data, specifically monitoring for error code 50126 and
  unsuccessful authentication attempts. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
  a brute force attack targeting the account. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could potentially gain unauthorized access, leading to data breaches or further
  exploitation within the environment. Security teams should adjust the threshold
  based on their specific environment to reduce false positives.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: A user with more than 20 failed authentication attempts in
  the span of 5 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
