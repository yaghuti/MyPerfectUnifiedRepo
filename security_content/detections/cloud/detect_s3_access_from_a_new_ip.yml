name: Detect S3 access from a new IP

description: The following analytic identifies access to an S3 bucket from a new or
  previously unseen remote IP address. It leverages S3 bucket-access logs, specifically
  focusing on successful access events (http_status=200). This activity is significant
  because access from unfamiliar IP addresses could indicate unauthorized access or
  potential data exfiltration attempts. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  lead to unauthorized data access, data theft, or further exploitation of the compromised
  S3 bucket, posing a significant risk to sensitive information stored within the
  bucket.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your S3 access
  logs' inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen S3 Bucket
  Access by Remote IP" support search once to create a history of previously seen
  remote IPs and bucket names.
known_false_positives: S3 buckets can be accessed from any IP, as long as it can make
  a successful connection. This will be a false postive, since the search is looking
  for a new IP within the past hour
