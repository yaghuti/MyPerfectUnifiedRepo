description: The following analytic detects unauthorized container uploads to AWS
  Elastic Container Service (ECR) by monitoring AWS CloudTrail events. It identifies
  instances where a new container is uploaded by a user not previously recognized
  as authorized. This detection is crucial for a SOC as it can indicate a potential
  compromise or misuse of AWS ECR, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
  data or the deployment of malicious containers. By identifying and investigating
  these events, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches or other security
  incidents resulting from unauthorized container uploads. The impact of such an attack
  could be significant, compromising the integrity and security of the organization's
  cloud environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
