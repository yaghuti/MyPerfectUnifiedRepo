description: |
  Microsoft Intune supports deploying packaged applications to support software deployment, this functionality can also be abused for deploying malicious payloads to intune managed devices. 
  This detection identifies when a new packaged application has been added, updated or deleted.

- Azure Monitor Activity

how_to_implement: |
  The Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services add-on is required to ingest In-Tune audit logs via Azure EventHub. 
  To configure this logging, visit Intune > Tenant administration > Diagnostic settings > Add diagnostic settings & send events to the activity audit event hub. 
  Deploy as a risk based alerting rule for quick deployment or perform baselining & tune accordingly. 
known_false_positives: Legitimate adminstrative usage of this functionality will trigger this detection.
