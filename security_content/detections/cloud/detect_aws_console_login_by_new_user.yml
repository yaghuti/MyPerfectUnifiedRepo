description: The following analytic detects AWS console login events by new users.
  It leverages AWS CloudTrail events and compares them against a lookup file of previously
  seen users based on ARN values. This detection is significant because a new user
  logging into the AWS console could indicate the creation of new accounts or potential
  unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized
  access to AWS resources, data exfiltration, or further exploitation within the cloud
  environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Authentication
  where Authentication.signature=ConsoleLogin by Authentication.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Authentication)`
  | join user type=outer [ | inputlookup previously_seen_users_console_logins | stats
  min(firstTime) as earliestseen by user] | eval userStatus=if(earliestseen >= relative_time(now(),
  "-24h@h") OR isnull(earliestseen), "First Time Logging into AWS Console", "Previously
  Seen User") | where userStatus="First Time Logging into AWS Console" | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_aws_console_login_by_new_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version
  5.1.0 or later) and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates
  to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Run the `Previously Seen Users
  in CloudTrail - Initial` support search only once to create a baseline of previously
  seen IAM users within the last 30 days. Run `Previously Seen Users in CloudTrail
  - Update` hourly (or more frequently depending on how often you run the detection
  searches) to refresh the baselines.
known_false_positives: When a legitimate new user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the user
  activity is legitimate.
