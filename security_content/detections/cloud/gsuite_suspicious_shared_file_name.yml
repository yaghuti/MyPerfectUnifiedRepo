description:
  The following analytic detects shared files in Google Drive with suspicious
  filenames commonly used in spear phishing campaigns. It leverages GSuite Drive logs
  to identify documents with titles that include keywords like "dhl," "ups," "invoice,"
  and "shipment." This activity is significant because such filenames are often used
  to lure users into opening malicious documents or clicking harmful links. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or further
  compromise of the user's system.
data_source:
  - G Suite Drive
search:
  '`gsuite_drive` parameters.owner_is_team_drive=false "parameters.doc_title"
  IN ("*dhl*", "* ups *", "*delivery*", "*parcel*", "*label*", "*invoice*", "*postal*",
  "*fedex*", "* usps *", "* express *", "*shipment*", "*Banking/Tax*","*shipment*",
  "*new order*") parameters.doc_type IN ("document","pdf", "msexcel", "msword", "spreadsheet",
  "presentation") | rex field=parameters.owner "[^@]+@(?<source_domain>[^@]+)" | rex
  field=parameters.target_user "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)" | where not source_domain="internal_test_email.com"
  and dest_domain="internal_test_email.com" | eval phase="plan" | eval severity="low"

  | `gsuite_suspicious_shared_file_name_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc. In order
  for the search to work for your environment, please edit the query to use your company
  specific email domain instead of `internal_test_email.com`.
known_false_positives:
  normal user or normal transaction may contain the subject and
  file type attachment that this detection try to search
