description: The following analytic detects an AWS CloudTrail event where a user with
  permissions updates the login profile of another user. It leverages CloudTrail logs
  to identify instances where the user making the change is different from the user
  whose profile is being updated. This activity is significant because it can indicate
  privilege escalation attempts, where an attacker uses a compromised account to gain
  higher privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could allow the attacker to escalate
  their privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over sensitive
  resources within the AWS environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately created keys for another user.
