description: The following analytic detects the creation of a new Automation Runbook
  Webhook within an Azure tenant. It leverages Azure Audit events, specifically the
  "Create or Update an Azure Automation webhook" operation, to identify this activity.
  This behavior is significant because Webhooks can trigger Automation Runbooks via
  unauthenticated URLs exposed to the Internet, posing a security risk. If confirmed
  malicious, an attacker could use this to execute code, create users, or maintain
  persistence within the environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access and
  control over Azure resources.

- Azure Audit Create or Update an Azure Automation webhook
search: '`azure_audit` operationName.value="Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts/webhooks/write" status.value=Succeeded 
  | dedup object 
  | rename claims.ipaddr as src_ip
  | rename caller as user 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(dest) as dest by object user, src_ip, resourceGroupName, object_path

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Audit events into your Splunk environment. Specifically,
  this analytic leverages the Azure Activity log category.
known_false_positives: Administrators may legitimately create Azure Runbook Webhooks.
  Filter as needed.
