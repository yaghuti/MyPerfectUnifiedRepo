description: The following analytic identifies when specific O365 advanced security
  settings are altered within the Office 365 tenant. If an attacker successfully disables
  O365 security settings, they can operate within the tenant with reduced risk of
  detection. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, account
  compromise, or other malicious activities without leaving a detailed audit trail.

- Office 365 Universal Audit Log

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Administrators might alter features for troubleshooting, performance
  reasons, or other administrative tasks. Filter as needed.
