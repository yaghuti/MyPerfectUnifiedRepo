description: The following analytic identifies instances where Multi-Factor Authentication
  (MFA) is disabled for a user within the Office 365 environment. It leverages O365
  audit logs, specifically focusing on events related to MFA settings. Disabling MFA
  removes a critical security layer, making accounts more vulnerable to unauthorized
  access. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an attacker attempting
  to maintain persistence or an insider threat, significantly increasing the risk
  of unauthorized access. Immediate investigation is required to validate the reason
  for disabling MFA, potentially re-enable it, and assess any other suspicious activities
  related to the affected account.

known_false_positives: Unless it is a special case, it is uncommon to disable MFA
  or Strong Authentication
