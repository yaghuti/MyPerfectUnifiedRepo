description: The following analytic identifies the creation of AWS IAM access keys
  by a user for another user, which can indicate privilege escalation. It leverages
  AWS CloudTrail logs to detect instances where the user creating the access key is
  different from the user for whom the key is created. This activity is significant
  because unauthorized access key creation can allow attackers to establish persistence
  or exfiltrate data via AWS APIs. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  access to AWS services, data exfiltration, and long-term persistence in the environment.
data_source:
- ASL AWS CloudTrail

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately created keys for another user.
