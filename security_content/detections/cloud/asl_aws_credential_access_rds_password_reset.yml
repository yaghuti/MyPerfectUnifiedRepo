description: The following analytic detects the resetting of the master user password
  for an Amazon RDS DB instance. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security
  Lake to identify events where the `ModifyDBInstance` API call includes a new `masterUserPassword`
  parameter. This activity is significant because unauthorized password resets can
  grant attackers access to sensitive data stored in production databases, such as
  credit card information, PII, and healthcare data. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational
  damage. Immediate investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of the password
  reset.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: Users may genuinely reset the RDS password.
