description: The following analytic identifies a successful single-factor authentication
  event against Azure Active Directory. It leverages Azure SignInLogs data, specifically
  focusing on events where single-factor authentication succeeded. This activity is
  significant as it may indicate a misconfiguration, policy violation, or potential
  account takeover attempt. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized
  access to the account, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation,
  or further exploitation within the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Although not recommended, certain users may be required without
  multi-factor authentication. Filter as needed
