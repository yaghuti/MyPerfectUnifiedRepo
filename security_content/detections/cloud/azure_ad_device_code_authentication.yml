description: The following analytic identifies Azure Device Code Phishing attacks,
  which can lead to Azure Account Take-Over (ATO). It leverages Azure AD SignInLogs
  to detect suspicious authentication requests using the device code authentication
  protocol. This activity is significant as it indicates potential bypassing of Multi-Factor
  Authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access Policies (CAPs) through phishing emails.
  If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access to Azure AD, Exchange
  mailboxes, and Outlook Web Application (OWA), leading to potential data breaches
  and unauthorized data access.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: In most organizations, device code authentication will be used
  to access common Microsoft service but it may be legitimate for others. Filter as
  needed.
