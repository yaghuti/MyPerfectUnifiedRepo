description: The following analytic identifies when Office 365 users search for suspicious keywords or have an excessive number of queries to a SharePoint site within a limited timeframe. This behavior may indicate that a malicious actor has gained control of a user account and is conducting discovery or enumeration activities.
data_source: 
- Office 365 Universal Audit Log
search: |-
  `o365_management_activity` (Workload=SharePoint Operation="SearchQueryPerformed" SearchQueryText=* EventData=*search*) OR Operation=SearchQueryInitiatedSharepoint 
  | eval command = case(Operation=="SearchQueryPerformed",SearchQueryText,true(),QueryText), UserId = lower(UserId), signature_id = CorrelationId, signature=Operation, src = ClientIP, user = lower(UserId), object_name=case(Operation=="SearchQueryPerformed",'EventData',true(),QuerySource), -time = _time, suspect_terms = case(match(command, `o365_suspect_search_terms_regex`),command,true(),null()) 
  | where command != "*" AND command != "(*)" 
  | bin _time span=1hr 
  | `o365_sharepoint_suspicious_search_behavior_filter`
  | stats values(ScenarioName) as app, values(object_name) as object_name values(command) as command, values(suspect_terms) as suspect_terms, values(src) as src, dc(suspect_terms) as suspect_terms_count, dc(command) as count, min(-time) as firstTime, max(-time) as lastTime by user,signature,_time 
  | where count > 20 OR suspect_terms_count >= 2 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events. The thresholds and match terms set within the analytic are initial guidelines and should be customized based on the organization's user behavior and risk profile. Security teams are encouraged to adjust these thresholds to optimize the balance between detecting genuine threats and minimizing false positives, ensuring the detection is tailored to their specific environment.
known_false_positives: Users searching excessively or possible false positives related to matching conditions.
