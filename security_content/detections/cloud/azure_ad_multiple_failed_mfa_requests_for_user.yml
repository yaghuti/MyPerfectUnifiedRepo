description: The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) requests for a single user within an Azure AD tenant. It leverages Azure AD
  Sign-in Logs, specifically error code 500121, to detect more than 10 failed MFA
  attempts within 10 minutes. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an adversary
  attempting to bypass MFA by bombarding the user with repeated authentication prompts.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, allowing
  attackers to compromise user accounts and potentially escalate their privileges
  within the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the Signin log category.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication
  or application issues. Filter as needed.
