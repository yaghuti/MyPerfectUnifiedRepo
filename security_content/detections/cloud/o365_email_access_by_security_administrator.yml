description: The following analytic identifies when a user with sufficient access
  to O365 Security & Compliance portal uses premium investigation features (Threat
  Explorer) to directly view email. Adversaries may exploit privileged access with
  this premium feature to enumerate or exfiltrate sensitive data.
data_source:
- Office 365 Universal Audit Log
search: '`o365_management_activity` Workload=SecurityComplianceCenter Operation=AdminMailAccess
  | rename InternetMessageId as signature_id, UserId as src_user | fillnull | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user src
  vendor_account vendor_product src_user signature_id | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `o365_email_access_by_security_administrator_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events. Threat Explorer is a premium feature with
  o365, logging may not be available with proper license.
known_false_positives: Legitamate access by security administators for incident response
  measures.
