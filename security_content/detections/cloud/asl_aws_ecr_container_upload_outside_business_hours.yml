description: The following analytic detects the upload of new containers to AWS Elastic
  Container Service (ECR) outside of standard business hours through AWS CloudTrail
  events. It identifies this behavior by monitoring for `PutImage` events occurring
  before 8 AM or after 8 PM, as well as any uploads on weekends. This activity is
  significant for a SOC to investigate as it may indicate unauthorized access or malicious
  deployments, potentially leading to compromised services or data breaches. Identifying
  and addressing such uploads promptly can mitigate the risk of security incidents
  and their associated impacts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: When your development is spreaded in different time zones, applying this rule can be difficult.
