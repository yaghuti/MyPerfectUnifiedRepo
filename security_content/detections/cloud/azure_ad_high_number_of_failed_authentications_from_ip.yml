name: Azure AD High Number Of Failed Authentications From Ip

author: Mauricio Velazco, Bhavin Patel, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects an IP address with 20 or more failed authentication
  attempts to an Azure AD tenant within 10 minutes. It leverages Azure AD SignInLogs
  to identify repeated failed logins from the same IP. This behavior is significant
  as it may indicate a brute force attack aimed at gaining unauthorized access or
  escalating privileges. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could potentially compromise
  user accounts, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources
  within the Azure environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: An Ip address with more than 20 failed authentication attempts
  in the span of 10 minutes may also be triggered by a broken application.
