description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a new AWS IAM policy
  version that allows access to all resources. It detects this activity by analyzing
  AWS CloudTrail logs for the CreatePolicyVersion event with a policy document that
  grants broad permissions. This behavior is significant because it violates the principle
  of least privilege, potentially exposing the environment to misuse or abuse. If
  confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain extensive access to AWS resources, leading
  to unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the AWS environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately created a policy to allow a user to access all resources. That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to all AWS resources and you must verify this activity.
