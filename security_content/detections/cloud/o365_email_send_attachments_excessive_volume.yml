type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies when an O365 email account sends an excessive number of email attachments to external recipients within a short period (within 1 hour). This behavior may indicate a compromised account where the threat actor is attempting to exfiltrate data from the mailbox. Threat actors may attempt to transfer data through email as a simple means of exfiltration from the compromised mailbox. Some account owner legitimate behaviors can trigger this alert, however these actions may not be aligned with organizational expectations / best practice behaviors.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events AND Message Trace events.
known_false_positives: Users or processes that are send a large number of attachments may trigger this alert, adjust thresholds accordingly.
