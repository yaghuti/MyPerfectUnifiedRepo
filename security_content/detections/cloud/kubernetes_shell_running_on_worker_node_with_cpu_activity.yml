name: Kubernetes Shell Running on Worker Node with CPU Activity

description: The following analytic identifies shell activity within the Kubernetes
  privilege scope on a worker node, specifically when shell processes are consuming
  CPU resources. It leverages process metrics from an OTEL collector hostmetrics receiver,
  pulled from Splunk Observability Cloud via the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring
  Add-on, focusing on process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization. This
  activity is significant as unauthorized shell processes can indicate a security
  threat, potentially compromising the node and the entire Kubernetes cluster. If
  confirmed malicious, attackers could gain full control over the host's resources,
  leading to data theft, service disruption, privilege escalation, and further attacks
  within the cluster.

how_to_implement: "To implement this detection, follow these steps:\n* Deploy the
  OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.\n* Enable the hostmetrics/process
  receiver in the OTEL configuration.\n* Ensure that the process metrics, specifically
  Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization, are enabled.\n* Install
  the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on. (ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247)\n
  * Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access
  Token.\n* Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input
  \"sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index\".\n* In the SIM configuration, set the Organization
  ID to your Observability Cloud Organization ID.\n* Set the Signal Flow Program to
  the following: data('process.threads').publish(label='A'); data('process.cpu.utilization').publish(label='B');
  data('process.cpu.time').publish(label='C'); data('process.disk.io').publish(label='D');
  data('process.memory.usage').publish(label='E'); data('process.memory.virtual').publish(label='F');
  data('process.memory.utilization').publish(label='G'); data('process.cpu.utilization').publish(label='H');
  data('process.disk.operations').publish(label='I'); data('process.handles').publish(label='J');
  data('process.threads').publish(label='K')\n* Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.\n
  * Leave all other settings at their default values.\n* Run the Search Baseline Of
  Kubernetes Container Network IO Ratio"
