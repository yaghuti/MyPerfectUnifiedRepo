description: The following analytic detects the creation of AWS KMS keys with an encryption
  policy accessible to everyone, including external entities. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs to identify `CreateKey` or `PutKeyPolicy` events where the `kms:Encrypt` action
  is granted to all principals. This activity is significant as it may indicate a
  compromised account, allowing an attacker to misuse the encryption key to target
  other organizations. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized data
  encryption, potentially disrupting operations and compromising sensitive information
  across multiple entities.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail CreateKey
- AWS CloudTrail PutKeyPolicy

how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs
