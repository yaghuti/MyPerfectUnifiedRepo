name: Azure AD New MFA Method Registered For User

description: The following analytic detects the registration of a new Multi-Factor
  Authentication (MFA) method for an Azure AD account. It leverages Azure AD AuditLogs
  to identify when a user registers new security information. This activity is significant
  because adversaries who gain unauthorized access to an account may add their own
  MFA method to maintain persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to bypass existing security controls, maintain long-term access, and potentially
  escalate their privileges within the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Newly onboarded users who are registering an MFA method for
  the first time will also trigger this detection.
