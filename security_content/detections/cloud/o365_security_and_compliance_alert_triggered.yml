description: The following analytic identifies alerts triggered by the Office 365
  Security and Compliance Center, indicating potential threats or policy violations.
  It leverages data from the `o365_management_activity` dataset, focusing on events
  where the workload is SecurityComplianceCenter and the operation is AlertTriggered.
  This activity is significant as it highlights security and compliance issues within
  the O365 environment, which are crucial for maintaining organizational security.
  If confirmed malicious, these alerts could indicate attempts to breach security
  policies, leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious
  activities.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: O365 Security and Compliance may also generate false positives
  or trigger on legitimate behavior, filter as needed.
