description: The following analytic detects the deletion of AWS CloudTrail logs by
  identifying `DeleteTrail` events within CloudTrail logs. This detection leverages
  CloudTrail data to monitor for successful `DeleteTrail` actions, excluding those
  initiated from the AWS console. This activity is significant because adversaries
  may delete CloudTrail logs to evade detection and operate stealthily within the
  compromised environment. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers
  to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their activities and potentially
  leading to prolonged unauthorized access and further exploitation.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteTrail
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName = DeleteTrail eventSource = cloudtrail.amazonaws.com userAgent !=console.amazonaws.com errorCode = success
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `aws_defense_evasion_delete_cloudtrail_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in
  your AWS Environment.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudTrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
