type: TTP
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies instances where a service principal
  in Office 365 Azure Active Directory assigns app roles without standard admin consent.
  It leverages `o365_management_activity` logs, specifically focusing on the 'Add
  app role assignment to service principal' operation. This activity is significant
  for SOCs as it may indicate a bypass of critical administrative controls, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to misuse automated processes to assign sensitive permissions,
  compromising the security of the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Service Principals are sometimes configured to legitimately
  bypass the consent process for purposes of automation. Filter as needed.
