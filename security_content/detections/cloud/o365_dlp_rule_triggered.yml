description: The following analytic detects when Microsoft Office 365 Data Loss Prevention
  (DLP) rules have been triggered. DLP rules can be configured for any number of security,
  regulatory, or business compliance reasons, as such this analytic will only be as
  accurate as the upstream DLP configuration. Detections from this analytic should
  be evaluated thoroughly to de termine what, if any, security relevance the underlying
  DLP events contain.
data_source:
- Office 365 Universal Audit Log

  signature_id = ''ExchangeMetaData.UniqueID'', signature = ''PolicyDetails{}.Rules{}.RuleName''

  result=''PolicyDetails{}.Rules{}.Actions{}'', file_name=case(NOT match(''PolicyDetails{}.Rules{}.ConditionsMatched.SensitiveInformation{}.Location'',"Message
  Body"),''PolicyDetails{}.Rules{}.ConditionsMatched.SensitiveInformation{}.Location'')

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events. You must deploy DLP rules through O365 security
  and compliance functions.
known_false_positives: WIll depending on accuracy of DLP rules, these can be noisy
  so tune appropriately.
