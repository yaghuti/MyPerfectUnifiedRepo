description: The following analytic identifies low, informational, or unknown severity
  findings from AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) image scans. It leverages AWS
  CloudTrail logs, specifically the DescribeImageScanFindings event, to detect these
  findings. This activity is significant for a SOC as it helps in early identification
  of potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in container images, which could
  be exploited if left unaddressed. If confirmed malicious, these findings could lead
  to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further exploitation within the containerized
  environment.

  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
