name: Detect New Open S3 Buckets over AWS CLI

description: The following analytic detects the creation of open/public S3 buckets
  via the AWS CLI. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify events where a user
  has set bucket permissions to allow access to "AuthenticatedUsers" or "AllUsers."
  This activity is significant because open S3 buckets can expose sensitive data to
  unauthorized users, leading to data breaches. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could gain unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information stored in the
  S3 bucket, posing a significant security risk.

how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS Cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to the "All Users"
  group.
