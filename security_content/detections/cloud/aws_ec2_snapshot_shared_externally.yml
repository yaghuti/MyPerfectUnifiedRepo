name: AWS EC2 Snapshot Shared Externally

description: The following analytic detects when an EC2 snapshot is shared with an
  external AWS account by analyzing AWS CloudTrail events. This detection method leverages
  CloudTrail logs to identify modifications in snapshot permissions, specifically
  when the snapshot is shared outside the originating AWS account. This activity is
  significant as it may indicate an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data stored in
  the snapshot. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access
  to the snapshot's data, potentially leading to data breaches or further exploitation
  of the compromised information.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ModifySnapshotAttribute
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ModifySnapshotAttribute 
  | rename requestParameters.createVolumePermission.add.items{}.userId as requested_account_id 
  | search requested_account_id != NULL 
  | eval match=if(requested_account_id==aws_account_id,"Match","No Match") 
  | where match = "No Match" 
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product requested_account_id
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `aws_ec2_snapshot_shared_externally_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately shared a
  snapshot with others for  a specific purpose.
