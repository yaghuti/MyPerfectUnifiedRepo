description: The following analytic identifiesGetPasswordData API calls in your AWS
  account. It leverages  CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake to detect this
  activity by counting the distinct instance IDs accessed. This behavior is significant
  as it may indicate an attempt to retrieve encrypted administrator passwords for
  running Windows instances, which is a critical security concern. If confirmed malicious,
  attackers could gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials, potentially
  leading to full control over the affected instances and further compromise of the
  AWS environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: Administrator tooling or automated scripts may make these calls but it is highly unlikely to make several calls in a short period of time.
