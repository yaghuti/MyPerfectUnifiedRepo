description: The following analytic identifies medium-severity findings from AWS Elastic
  Container Registry (ECR) image scans. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs, specifically
  the DescribeImageScanFindings event, to detect vulnerabilities in container images.
  This activity is significant for a SOC as it highlights potential security risks
  in containerized applications, which could be exploited if not addressed. If confirmed
  malicious, these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,
  or further exploitation within the container environment, compromising the overall
  security posture.

  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
