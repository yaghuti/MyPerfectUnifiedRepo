description: The following analytic identifies instances where new IP addresses are
  added to the trusted IPs list in Office 365, potentially allowing users from these
  IPs to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) during login. It leverages O365
  audit logs, specifically focusing on events related to the modification of trusted
  IP settings. This activity is significant because adding trusted IPs can weaken
  the security posture by bypassing MFA, which is a critical security control. If
  confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, compromising sensitive
  information and systems. Immediate investigation is required to validate the legitimacy
  of the IP addition.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Microsoft Office 365 add-on. This search
  works with o365:management:activity
known_false_positives: Unless it is a special case, it is uncommon to continually
  update Trusted IPs to MFA configuration.
