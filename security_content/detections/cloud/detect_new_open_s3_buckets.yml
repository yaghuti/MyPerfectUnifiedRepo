description: The following analytic identifies the creation of open/public S3 buckets
  in AWS. It detects this activity by analyzing AWS CloudTrail events for `PutBucketAcl`
  actions where the access control list (ACL) grants permissions to all users or authenticated
  users. This activity is significant because open S3 buckets can expose sensitive
  data to unauthorized access, leading to data breaches. If confirmed malicious, an
  attacker could read, write, or fully control the contents of the bucket, potentially
  leading to data exfiltration or tampering.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a public bucket for a specific purpose.
  That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to the "All Users"
  group.
