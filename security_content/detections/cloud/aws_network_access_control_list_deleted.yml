description: The following analytic detects the deletion of AWS Network Access Control
  Lists (ACLs). It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify events where a user deletes
  a network ACL entry. This activity is significant because deleting a network ACL
  can remove critical access restrictions, potentially allowing unauthorized access
  to cloud instances. If confirmed malicious, this action could enable attackers to
  bypass network security controls, leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
  or further compromise of the cloud environment.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your AWS CloudTrail
  inputs.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a user has legitimately deleted a network
  ACL.
