description: The following analytic detects the successful deletion of a group within
  AWS IAM, leveraging CloudTrail IAM events. This action, while not inherently malicious,
  can serve as a precursor to more sinister activities, such as unauthorized access
  or privilege escalation attempts. By monitoring for such deletions, the analytic
  aids in identifying potential preparatory steps towards an attack, allowing for
  early detection and mitigation. The identification of this behavior is crucial for
  a SOC to prevent the potential impact of an attack, which could include unauthorized
  access to sensitive resources or disruption of AWS environment operations.

how_to_implement: You must install the Data Lake Federated Analytics App and ingest the logs into Splunk.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations) or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to delete groups (least privilege).
