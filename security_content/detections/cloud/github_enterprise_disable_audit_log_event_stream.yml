description: The following analytic detects when a user disables audit log event streaming in GitHub Enterprise. 
  The detection monitors GitHub Enterprise audit logs for configuration changes that disable the audit log streaming functionality, 
  which is used to send audit events to security monitoring platforms. This behavior could indicate an attacker attempting to prevent 
  their malicious activities from being logged and detected by disabling the audit trail. For a SOC, identifying the disabling of 
  audit logging is critical as it may be a precursor to other attacks where adversaries want to operate undetected. The impact could 
  be severe as organizations lose visibility into user actions, configuration changes, and security events within their 
  GitHub Enterprise environment, potentially allowing attackers to perform malicious activities without detection. 
  This creates a significant blind spot in security monitoring and incident response capabilities.

how_to_implement: You must ingest GitHub Enterprise logs using Audit log streaming as described in this documentation https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-splunk using a Splunk HTTP Event Collector.
