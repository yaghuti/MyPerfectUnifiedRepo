description: The following analytic detects when a user removes an organization from GitHub Enterprise. 
  The detection monitors GitHub Enterprise audit logs for organization deletion events, which could indicate unauthorized removal of critical business resources. 
  For a SOC, identifying organization removals is crucial as it may signal account compromise, insider threats, or malicious attempts to disrupt business operations 
  by deleting entire organizational structures. The impact could be severe, potentially resulting in loss of source code, repositories, team structures, access controls, 
  and other critical organizational assets. This disruption could halt development workflows, cause data loss, and require significant effort to restore from backups 
  if available. Additionally, unauthorized organization removal could be part of a larger attack campaign aimed at destroying or compromising enterprise assets.

how_to_implement: You must ingest GitHub Enterprise logs using Audit log streaming as described in this documentation https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-splunk using a Splunk HTTP Event Collector.
