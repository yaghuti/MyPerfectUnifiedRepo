description: The following analytic detects `UpdateTrail` events within AWS CloudTrail
  logs, aiming to identify attempts by attackers to evade detection by altering logging
  configurations. By updating CloudTrail settings with incorrect parameters, such
  as changing multi-regional logging to a single region, attackers can impair the
  logging of their activities across other regions. This behavior is crucial for Security
  Operations Centers (SOCs) to identify, as it indicates an adversary's intent to
  operate undetected within a compromised AWS environment. The impact of such evasion
  tactics is significant, potentially allowing malicious activities to proceed without
  being logged, thereby hindering incident response and forensic investigations.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has updated cloudtrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
