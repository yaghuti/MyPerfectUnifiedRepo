description: The following analytic detects unusual authentication activity in Azure
  AD, specifically when a single user account has over 8 authentication attempts using
  3+ unique application IDs and 5+ unique user agents within a short period. It leverages
  Azure AD audit logs, focusing on authentication events and using statistical thresholds.
  This behavior is significant as it may indicate an adversary probing for MFA requirements.
  If confirmed malicious, it suggests a compromised account, potentially leading to
  further exploitation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Early detection is
  crucial to prevent substantial harm.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment
  through an EventHub. This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad
  sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Rapid authentication from the same user using more than 5 different
  user agents and 3 application IDs is highly unlikely under normal circumstances.
  However, there are potential scenarios that could lead to false positives.
