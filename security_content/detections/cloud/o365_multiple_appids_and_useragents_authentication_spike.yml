name: O365 Multiple AppIDs and UserAgents Authentication Spike

status: production
type: Anomaly
data_source:
- O365 UserLoggedIn
- O365 UserLoginFailed
description: The following analytic identifies unusual authentication activity in
  an O365 environment, where a single user account experiences more than 8 authentication
  attempts using 3 or more unique application IDs and over 5 unique user agents within
  a short timeframe. It leverages O365 audit logs, focusing on authentication events
  and applying statistical thresholds. This behavior is significant as it may indicate
  an adversary probing for multi-factor authentication weaknesses. If confirmed malicious,
  it suggests a compromised account, potentially leading to unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, and data exfiltration. Early detection is crucial to prevent further
  exploitation.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Rapid authentication from the same user using more than 5 different
  user agents and 3 application IDs is highly unlikely under normal circumstances.
  However, there are potential scenarios that could lead to false positives.
