description: The following analytic identifies the successful deletion of an IAM group
  in AWS. It leverages CloudTrail logs to detect `DeleteGroup` events with a success
  status. This activity is significant as it could indicate potential changes in user
  permissions or access controls, which may be a precursor to further unauthorized
  actions. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could disrupt access management, potentially
  leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to sensitive resources. Analysts
  should review related IAM events, such as recent user additions or new group creations,
  to assess the broader context.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteGroup
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource=iam.amazonaws.com eventName=DeleteGroup errorCode=success (userAgent!=*.amazonaws.com) 
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_iam_successful_group_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on and Splunk App for AWS is required to utilize
  this data. The search requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete groups (least privilege).
