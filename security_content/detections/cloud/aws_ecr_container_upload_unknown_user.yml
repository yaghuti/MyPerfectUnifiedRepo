description: The following analytic detects the upload of a new container image to
  AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) by an unknown user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail
  logs to identify `PutImage` events from the ECR service, filtering out known users.
  This activity is significant because container uploads should typically be performed
  by a limited set of authorized users. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate
  unauthorized access, potentially leading to the deployment of malicious containers,
  data exfiltration, or further compromise of the AWS environment.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail PutImage
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource=ecr.amazonaws.com eventName=PutImage NOT `aws_ecr_users`
  | rename requestParameters.* as * 
  | rename repositoryName AS image 
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product image

  | `aws_ecr_container_upload_unknown_user_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
