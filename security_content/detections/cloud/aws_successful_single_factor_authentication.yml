description: The following analytic identifies a successful Console Login authentication
  event for an AWS IAM user account without Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled.
  It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to detect instances where MFA was not used during
  login. This activity is significant as it may indicate a misconfiguration, policy
  violation, or potential account takeover attempt. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could gain unauthorized access to the AWS environment, potentially leading to data
  exfiltration, resource manipulation, or further privilege escalation.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ConsoleLogin
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName= ConsoleLogin errorCode=success "additionalEventData.MFAUsed"=No
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `aws_successful_single_factor_authentication_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on is required to utilize this data. The search
  requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that some accounts do not have MFA enabled for
  the AWS account however its agaisnt the best practices of securing AWS.
