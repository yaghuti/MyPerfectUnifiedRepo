description: The following analytic identifies the assignment of elevated mailbox
  permissions in an Office 365 environment via the Add-MailboxPermission operation.
  It leverages logs from the Exchange workload in the o365_management_activity data
  source, focusing on permissions such as FullAccess, ChangePermission, or ChangeOwner.
  This activity is significant as it indicates potential unauthorized access or control
  over mailboxes, which could lead to data exfiltration or privilege escalation. If
  confirmed malicious, attackers could gain extensive access to sensitive email data
  and potentially manipulate mailbox settings, posing a severe security risk.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: FullAccess mailbox delegation may be assigned for legitimate
  purposes, filter as needed.
