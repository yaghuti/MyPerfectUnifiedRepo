description: The following analytic detects when the Microsoft Zero-hour Automatic
  Purge (ZAP) capability takes action against a user's mailbox. This capability is
  an enhanced protection feature that retro-actively removes email with known malicious
  content for user inboxes. Since this is a retroactive capability, there is still
  a window in which the user may fall victim to the malicious content.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events. Some features of Zero-hour purge are only
  offered within E3/E5 license level tenants, events may not be available otherwise.
