description: The following analytic identifies when a malicious file is detected within
  the SharePoint Online ecosystem. Attackers may stage and execute malicious files
  from within the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem. Any detections from built-in Office
  365 capabilities should be monitored and responded to appropriately. Certain premium
  Office 365 capabilities further enhance these detection and response functions.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest
  Office 365 management activity events.
