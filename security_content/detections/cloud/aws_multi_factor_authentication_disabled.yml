description: The following analytic detects attempts to disable multi-factor authentication
  (MFA) for an AWS IAM user. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify events where
  MFA devices are deleted or deactivated. This activity is significant because disabling
  MFA can indicate an adversary attempting to weaken account security, potentially
  to maintain persistence using a compromised account. If confirmed malicious, this
  action could allow attackers to retain access to the AWS environment without detection,
  posing a significant risk to the security and integrity of the cloud infrastructure.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail DeleteVirtualMFADevice
- AWS CloudTrail DeactivateMFADevice
search: '`cloudtrail` (eventName= DeleteVirtualMFADevice OR eventName=DeactivateMFADevice)
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_multi_factor_authentication_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: The Splunk AWS Add-on is required to utilize this data. The search
  requires AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: AWS Administrators may disable MFA but it is highly unlikely
  for this event to occur without prior notice to the company
