description: The following analytic detects the resetting of the master user password
  for an Amazon RDS DB instance. It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify events
  where the `ModifyDBInstance` API call includes a new `masterUserPassword` parameter.
  This activity is significant because unauthorized password resets can grant attackers
  access to sensitive data stored in production databases, such as credit card information,
  PII, and healthcare data. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data breaches,
  regulatory non-compliance, and significant reputational damage. Immediate investigation
  is required to determine the legitimacy of the password reset.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail ModifyDBInstance
search: '`cloudtrail` eventSource="rds.amazonaws.com" eventName=ModifyDBInstance "requestParameters.masterUserPassword"=*
  | rename user_name as user
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(requestParameters.dBInstanceIdentifier) as database_id by signature dest user user_agent src vendor_account vendor_region vendor_product
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_credential_access_rds_password_reset_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: Users may genuinely reset the RDS password.
