description: The following analytic detects `StopLogging` events within AWS CloudTrail
  logs, a critical action that adversaries may use to evade detection. By halting
  the logging of their malicious activities, attackers aim to operate undetected within
  a compromised AWS environment. This detection is achieved by monitoring for specific
  CloudTrail log entries that indicate the cessation of logging activities. Identifying
  such behavior is crucial for a Security Operations Center (SOC), as it signals an
  attempt to undermine the integrity of logging mechanisms, potentially allowing malicious
  activities to proceed without observation. The impact of this evasion tactic is
  significant, as it can severely hamper incident response and forensic investigations
  by obscuring the attacker's actions.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on Amazon Security Lake events from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a centralized data lake that provides security-related data from AWS services. To use this detection, you must ingest CloudTrail logs from Amazon Security Lake into Splunk. To run this search, ensure that you ingest events using the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Amazon Web Services (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) or the Federated Analytics App.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that an AWS admin has stopped cloudtrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
