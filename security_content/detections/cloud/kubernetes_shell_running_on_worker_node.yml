name: Kubernetes Shell Running on Worker Node

description: The following analytic identifies shell activity within the Kubernetes
  privilege scope on a worker node. It leverages process metrics from an OTEL collector
  hostmetrics receiver, specifically process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization,
  pulled from Splunk Observability Cloud. This activity is significant as unauthorized
  shell processes can indicate potential security threats, providing attackers an
  entry point to compromise the node and the entire Kubernetes cluster. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to data theft, service disruption, privilege
  escalation, lateral movement, and further attacks, severely compromising the cluster's
  security and integrity.

how_to_implement: "To implement this detection, follow these steps:\n* Deploy the
  OpenTelemetry Collector (OTEL) to your Kubernetes cluster.\n* Enable the hostmetrics/process
  receiver in the OTEL configuration.\n* Ensure that the process metrics, specifically
  Process.cpu.utilization and process.memory.utilization, are enabled.\n* Install
  the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring (SIM) add-on. (ref: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5247)\n
  * Configure the SIM add-on with your Observability Cloud Organization ID and Access
  Token.\n* Set up the SIM modular input to ingest Process Metrics. Name this input
  \"sim_process_metrics_to_metrics_index\".\n* In the SIM configuration, set the Organization
  ID to your Observability Cloud Organization ID.\n* Set the Signal Flow Program to
  the following: data('process.threads').publish(label='A'); data('process.cpu.utilization').publish(label='B');
  data('process.cpu.time').publish(label='C'); data('process.disk.io').publish(label='D');
  data('process.memory.usage').publish(label='E'); data('process.memory.virtual').publish(label='F');
  data('process.memory.utilization').publish(label='G'); data('process.cpu.utilization').publish(label='H');
  data('process.disk.operations').publish(label='I'); data('process.handles').publish(label='J');
  data('process.threads').publish(label='K')\n* Set the Metric Resolution to 10000.\n
  * Leave all other settings at their default values.\n* Run the Search Baseline Of
  Kubernetes Container Network IO Ratio"
