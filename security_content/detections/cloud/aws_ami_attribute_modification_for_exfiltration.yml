description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to AWS AMI attributes,
  such as sharing an AMI with another AWS account or making it publicly accessible.
  It leverages AWS CloudTrail logs to identify these changes by monitoring specific
  API calls. This activity is significant because adversaries can exploit these modifications
  to exfiltrate sensitive data stored in AWS resources. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches, compromising the
  confidentiality and integrity of organizational information.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=ModifyImageAttribute (requestParameters.launchPermission.add.items{}.userId
  = * OR requestParameters.launchPermission.add.items{}.group = all) 
  | rename requestParameters.launchPermission.add.items{}.group as group_added 
  | rename requestParameters.launchPermission.add.items{}.userId as accounts_added 
  | eval ami_status=if(match(group_added,"all") ,"Public AMI", "Not Public")

how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with AWS CloudTrail logs.
known_false_positives: It is possible that an AWS admin has legitimately shared a
  snapshot with others for  a specific purpose.
