description: |
  This analytic detects unexpected outbound network connections initiated by known webserver processes such as `httpd.exe`, `nginx.exe`, or `tomcat.exe` to common file sharing or public content hosting services like GitHub, Discord CDN, Transfer.sh, or Pastebin.
  Webservers are rarely expected to perform outbound downloads, especially to dynamic or anonymous file hosting domains. This behavior is often associated with server compromise,
  where an attacker uses a reverse shell, webshell, or injected task to fetch malware or tools post-exploitation.
  The detection leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module flow data, enriched with process context, to identify this highly suspicious behavior.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  In rare cases, a web server may make outbound connections to pull content for legitimate purposes (e.g., downloading templates or updates from a trusted source).
  However, communication to anonymous file-sharing or temporary content domains is strongly suspicious.
  If legitimate use is confirmed, domain- or process-level allowlisting is recommended.
