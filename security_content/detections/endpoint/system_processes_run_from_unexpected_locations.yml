description: The following analytic identifies system processes running from unexpected
  locations outside of paths such as `C:\Windows\System32\` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process paths,
  names, and hashes. This activity is significant as it may indicate a malicious process
  attempting to masquerade as a legitimate system process. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow an attacker to execute code, escalate privileges, or maintain
  persistence within the environment, posing a significant security risk.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This detection may require tuning based on third party applications
  utilizing native Windows binaries in non-standard paths.
