description: The following analytic identifies attempts to stop services on a system
  using `net.exe`, `sc.exe` or the "Stop-Service" cmdlet. It leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry. This activity can be significant as adversaries often
  terminate security or critical services to evade detection and further their objectives.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to disable security
  defenses, facilitate ransomware encryption, or disrupt essential services, leading
  to potential data loss or system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Windows OS or software may stop and restart services due to
  some critical update.
