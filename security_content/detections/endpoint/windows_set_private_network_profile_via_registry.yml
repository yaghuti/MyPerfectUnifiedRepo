name: Windows Set Private Network Profile via Registry

description: The following analytic detects attempts to modify the Windows Registry to change a network profile's category to "Private", which may indicate an adversary is preparing the environment for lateral movement or reducing firewall restrictions. Specifically, this activity involves changes to the Category value within the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles\{GUID} registry path. A value of 1 corresponds to a private network profile, which typically enables less restrictive firewall policies. While this action can occur during legitimate network configuration, it may also be a sign of malicious behavior when combined with other indicators such as suspicious account activity, unexpected administrative privilege usage, or execution of unsigned binaries. Monitoring for this registry modification—especially outside standard IT processes or correlated with persistence mechanisms—can help identify stealthy post-exploitation activity.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives:
  Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive, however is not common. Filter as needed.
