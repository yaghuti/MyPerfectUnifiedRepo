description:
  The following analytic detects the modification of the Windows registry
  using the regedit.exe application with the silent mode parameter. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and
  command-line executions. This activity is significant because the silent mode allows
  registry changes without user confirmation, which can be exploited by adversaries
  to import malicious registry settings. If confirmed malicious, this could enable
  attackers to persist in the environment, escalate privileges, or manipulate system
  configurations, leading to potential system compromise.

how_to_implement:
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
