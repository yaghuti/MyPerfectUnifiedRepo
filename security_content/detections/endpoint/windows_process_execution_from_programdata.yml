type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies processes running from file paths within
  the ProgramData directory, a common location abused by adversaries for executing
  malicious code while evading detection. Threat actors often drop and execute payloads
  from this directory to bypass security controls, as it typically has write permissions
  for standard users. While this behavior can indicate malware execution or persistence
  techniques, it is important to note that some legitimate software, installers, and
  update mechanisms also run from ProgramData, leading to potential false positives.
  Security teams should validate detections by correlating with other indicators,
  such as unusual parent processes, unsigned binaries, or anomalous network activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow execution of specific binaries in
  non-standard paths. Filter as needed.
