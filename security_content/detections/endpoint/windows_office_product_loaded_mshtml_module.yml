type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the loading of the mshtml.dll module into
  an Office product, which is indicative of CVE-2021-40444 exploitation. It leverages
  Sysmon EventID 7 to monitor image loads by specific Office processes. This activity
  is significant because it can indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in
  the MSHTML component via a malicious document. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise,
  data exfiltration, or further network penetration.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventID=7 process_name IN ("EQNEDT32.exe", "excel.exe", "Graph.exe",
  "msaccess.exe", "mspub.exe", "onenote.exe", "onenoteim.exe", "onenotem.exe", "outlook.exe",
  "powerpnt.exe", "visio.exe", "winproj.exe", "winword.exe", "wordpad.exe", "wordview.exe")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process names and image loads from your endpoints. If you are using
  Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives will be present, however, tune as necessary.
  Some applications may legitimately load mshtml.dll.
