description:
  The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator
  in PowerShell to query Active Directory for domain groups. It leverages PowerShell
  Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify specific script blocks containing
  `[adsisearcher]` and group-related queries. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt by adversaries or Red Teams to enumerate domain groups for situational
  awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could lead to further reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or lateral movement
  within the network.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` (ScriptBlockText = "*[adsisearcher]*" AND ScriptBlockText =
  "*(objectcategory=group)*" AND ScriptBlockText = "*findAll()*") | fillnull | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id
  user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `domain_group_discovery_with_adsisearcher_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use Adsisearcher for troubleshooting.
