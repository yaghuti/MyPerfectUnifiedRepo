description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the `Invoke-WmiMethod`
  commandlet with parameters used to start a process on a remote endpoint via WMI,
  leveraging PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This method identifies
  specific script block text patterns associated with remote process instantiation.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code
  execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary code on remote systems, potentially leading to further compromise
  and persistence within the network.

  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104

  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText="*Invoke-WmiMethod*" AND (ScriptBlockText="*-CN*"
  OR ScriptBlockText="*-ComputerName*") AND ScriptBlockText="*-Class Win32_Process*"
  AND ScriptBlockText="*-Name create*" | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `remote_process_instantiation_via_wmi_and_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup instructions
  can be found https://help.splunk.com/en/security-offerings/splunk-user-behavior-analytics/get-data-in/5.4.1/add-other-data-to-splunk-uba/configure-powershell-logging-to-see-powershell-anomalies-in-splunk-uba.
known_false_positives:
  Administrators may leverage WWMI and powershell.exe to start
  a process on remote systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set
  of hosts or users.
