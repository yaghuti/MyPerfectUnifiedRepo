description:
  The following analytic detects suspicious PowerShell script execution
  involving the cryptography namespace via EventCode 4104. It leverages PowerShell
  Script Block Logging to identify scripts using cryptographic functions, excluding
  common hashes like SHA and MD5. This activity is significant as it is often associated
  with malware that decrypts or decodes additional malicious payloads. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute further code, escalate privileges,
  or establish persistence within the environment. Analysts should investigate the
  parent process, decrypted data, network connections, and the user executing the
  script.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*System.Security.Cryptography*"
  AND NOT(ScriptBlockText IN ("*SHA*", "*MD5*", "*DeriveBytes*")) | fillnull | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id
  user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_powershell_cryptography_namespace_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives: False positives should be limited. Filter as needed.
