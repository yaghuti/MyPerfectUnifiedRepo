description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments used to query domain groups via the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet
  and the `-class ds_group` parameter. This detection leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance
  efforts by adversaries to enumerate domain groups, which is a common step in Active
  Directory Discovery. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gain
  insights into the domain structure, aiding in further attacks and privilege escalation.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
