description: The following analytic detects suspicious attempts to find SSH private
  keys, which may indicate an attacker's effort to compromise secure access to systems.
  SSH private keys are essential for secure authentication, and unauthorized access
  to these keys can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to servers and other
  critical infrastructure. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized searches for
  SSH private keys, this analytic helps identify potential threats to network security,
  allowing security teams to quickly respond and safeguard against unauthorized access
  and potential breaches.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` execve_command IN ("*find*", "*grep*") AND execve_command IN ("*id_rsa*", "*id_dsa*", "*.key*", "*ssh_key*", "*authorized_keys*")
  | rename host as dest 
  | rename comm as process_name 
  | rename exe as process 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by argc execve_command dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_auditd_find_ssh_private_keys_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures
  command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should
  be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
