  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the Invoke-ShareFinder
  PowerShell cmdlet from PowerView. This detection leverages PowerShell Script Block
  Logging to identify instances where this specific command is executed. Monitoring
  this activity is crucial as it indicates an attempt to enumerate network file shares,
  which may contain sensitive information such as backups, scripts, and credentials.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable an attacker to escalate privileges
  or move laterally within the network, potentially compromising additional systems
  and sensitive data.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  Security teams may leverage PowerView proactively to identify
  and remediate sensitive file shares. Filter as needed.
