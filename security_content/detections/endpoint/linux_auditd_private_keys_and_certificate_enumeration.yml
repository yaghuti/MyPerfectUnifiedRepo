description: The following analytic detects suspicious attempts to find private keys,
  which may indicate an attacker's effort to access sensitive cryptographic information.
  Private keys are crucial for securing encrypted communications and data, and unauthorized
  access to them can lead to severe security breaches, including data decryption and
  identity theft. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized searches for private keys,
  this analytic helps identify potential threats to cryptographic security, enabling
  security teams to take swift action to protect the integrity and confidentiality
  of encrypted information.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` execve_command IN ("*find*", "*grep*") 
  AND execve_command IN ("*.pem*", "*.cer*", "*.crt*", "*.pgp*", "*.key*", "*.gpg*", "*.ppk*", "*.p12*", "*.pfx*", "*.p7b*")
  | rename host as dest 
  | rename comm as process_name 
  | rename exe as process 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by argc execve_command dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_auditd_private_keys_and_certificate_enumeration_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures
  command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should
  be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
