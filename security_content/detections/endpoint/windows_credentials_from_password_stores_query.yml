description: The following analytic detects the execution of the Windows OS tool cmdkey.exe,
  which is often abused by post-exploitation tools like winpeas, commonly used in
  ransomware attacks to list stored usernames, passwords, or credentials. This detection
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  execution logs. This activity is significant as it indicates potential credential
  harvesting, which can lead to privilege escalation and persistence. If confirmed
  malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and
  maintain control over compromised systems for further exploitation.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.
