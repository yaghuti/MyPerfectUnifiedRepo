description: The following analytic detects suspicious file permissions modifications
  using the chattr command, which may indicate an attacker attempting to manipulate
  file attributes to evade detection or prevent alteration. The chattr command can
  be used to make files immutable or restrict deletion, which can be leveraged to
  protect malicious files or disrupt system operations. By monitoring for unusual
  or unauthorized chattr usage, this analytic helps identify potential tampering with
  critical files, enabling security teams to quickly respond to and mitigate threats
  associated with unauthorized file attribute changes.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` proctitle = "*chattr *" AND proctitle = "* -i*"
  | rename host as dest 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by proctitle dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`linux_auditd_file_permissions_modification_via_chattr_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures
  command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should
  be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
