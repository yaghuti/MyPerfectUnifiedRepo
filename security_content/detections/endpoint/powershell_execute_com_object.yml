description: The following analytic detects the execution of a COM CLSID through PowerShell.
  It leverages EventCode 4104 and searches for specific script block text indicating
  the creation of a COM object. This activity is significant as it is commonly used
  by adversaries and malware, such as the Conti ransomware, to execute commands, potentially
  for privilege escalation or bypassing User Account Control (UAC). If confirmed malicious,
  this technique could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges or persist within
  the environment, posing a significant security risk.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromCLSID*"
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID
  ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_execute_com_object_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: network operrator may use this command.
