name: Windows Disable Memory Crash Dump

description: The following analytic detects attempts to disable the memory crash dump
  feature on Windows systems by setting the registry value to 0. It leverages data
  from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically monitoring changes to the CrashDumpEnabled
  registry key. This activity is significant because disabling crash dumps can hinder
  forensic analysis and incident response efforts. If confirmed malicious, this action
  could be part of a broader attack strategy, such as data destruction or system destabilization,
  as seen with HermeticWiper, potentially leading to significant operational disruptions
  and data loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  where (Registry.registry_path="*\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CrashControl\\CrashDumpEnabled")
  AND Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000000" by Registry.action Registry.dest Registry.process_guid
  Registry.process_id Registry.registry_hive Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_disable_memory_crash_dump_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` and `Registry`
  node.
