description: The following analytic detects the execution of ngrok.exe on a Windows
  operating system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  because while ngrok is a legitimate tool for creating secure tunnels, it is increasingly
  used by adversaries to bypass network defenses and establish reverse proxies. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to exfiltrate data, maintain persistence,
  or facilitate further attacks by tunneling traffic through the compromised system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on organizations that
  allow the use of Ngrok. Filter or monitor as needed.
