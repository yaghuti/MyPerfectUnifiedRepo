description: The following analytic detects processes with command lines containing
  named pipes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process command-line executions. This behavior is significant as it
  is often used by adversaries, such as those behind the Olympic Destroyer malware,
  for inter-process communication post-injection, aiding in defense evasion and privilege
  escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to maintain
  persistence, escalate privileges, or evade defenses, potentially leading to further
  compromise of the system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Normal browser application may use this technique. Please update
  the filter macros to remove false positives.
