description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the PowerShell command
  'Get-Clipboard' to retrieve clipboard data. It leverages PowerShell Script Block
  Logging (EventCode 4104) to identify instances where this command is used. This
  activity is significant because it can indicate an attempt to steal sensitive information
  such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential data copied to the clipboard.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive
  information, potentially compromising user accounts and other critical assets.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Get-Clipboard*" | fillnull
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id
  user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_clipboard_data_via_get_clipboard_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
