description: This detection identifies unsigned DLLs loaded through DLL side-loading
  with same file path with the process loaded the DLL, a technique observed in DarkGate
  malware. This detection monitors DLL loading, verifies signatures, and flags unsigned
  DLLs. Suspicious file paths and known executable associations are checked. Detecting
  such suspicious DLLs is crucial in preventing privilege escalation attacks and other
  potential security breaches. Regular security assessments, thorough monitoring,
  and implementing security best practices are essential in safeguarding systems from
  such threats.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
