- Windows Event Log Security 4663
description: The following analytic detects non-Chrome processes accessing the 
  Chrome "Local State" file, which contains critical settings and information. 
  It leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically event code 4663, to 
  identify this behavior. This activity is significant because threat actors can
  exploit this file to extract the encrypted master key used for decrypting 
  saved passwords in Chrome. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to 
  unauthorized access to sensitive information, posing a severe security risk. 
  Monitoring this anomaly helps identify potential threats and safeguard 
  browser-stored data.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 object_file_path="*\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User
  Data\\Local State" NOT (process_name IN ("*\\chrome.exe","*:\\Windows\\explorer.exe"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by object_file_name
  object_file_path process_name process_path  process_id EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_credentials_from_password_stores_chrome_localstate_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows
  Security Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object 
  Access" in Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" 
  and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall chrome application may access this file and 
  folder path to removed chrome installation in target host. Filter is needed.
