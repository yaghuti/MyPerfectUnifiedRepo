description: The following analytic identifies potential DLL side-loading instances
  involving unsigned DLLs mimicking Microsoft signatures. It detects this activity
  by analyzing Sysmon logs for Event Code 7, where both the `Image` and `ImageLoaded`
  paths do not match system directories like `system32`, `syswow64`, and `programfiles`.
  This behavior is significant as adversaries often exploit DLL side-loading to execute
  malicious code via legitimate processes. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to privilege escalation,
  persistence, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

  "C:\\Program Files*")) | rex field=Image "(?<ImageFolderPath>.+\\\)" | rex field=ImageLoaded

how_to_implement: The analytic is designed to be run against Sysmon event logs collected
  from endpoints. The analytic requires the Sysmon event logs to be ingested into
  Splunk. The analytic searches for EventCode 7 where the Image is either SQLDumper.exe
  or SQLWriter.exe and the ImageLoaded is vcruntime140.dll. The search also filters
  out the legitimate loading of vcruntime140.dll from the System32 directory to reduce
  false positives. The analytic can be modified to include additional known good paths
  for vcruntime140.dll to further reduce false positives.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate processes are loading
  vcruntime140.dll from non-standard directories. It is recommended to investigate
  the context of the process loading vcruntime140.dll to determine if it is malicious
  or not. Modify the search to include additional known good paths for vcruntime140.dll
  to reduce false positives.
