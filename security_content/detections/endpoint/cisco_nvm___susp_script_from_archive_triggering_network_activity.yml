description: |
  This analytic detects script execution (`wscript.exe` or `cscript.exe`) triggered from compressed files opened directly using
  `explorer.exe`, `winrar.exe`, or `7zFM.exe`.
  When a user double clicks on a ".js" file from within one of these compressed files. Its extracted temporally in the temp directory in folder with certain markers.
  It leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module (NVM) flow data, in order to look for a specific parent/child relationship and an initiated network connection.
  This behavior is exploited by threat actors such as Scarlet Goldfinch to deliver and run malicious scripts as an initial access technique.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  Some software installers or automation scripts may extract and run scripts from archive files in temporary directories.
  However, it is uncommon for such scripts to initiate outbound network connections immediately upon extraction.
  This behavior should be considered suspicious and investigated, especially in environments where such scripting is not typical.
