name: Windows Access Token Winlogon Duplicate Handle In Uncommon Path

description: The following analytic detects a process attempting to duplicate 
  the handle of winlogon.exe from an uncommon or public source path. This is 
  identified using Sysmon EventCode 10, focusing on processes targeting 
  winlogon.exe with specific access rights and excluding common system paths. 
  This activity is significant because it may indicate an adversary trying to 
  escalate privileges by leveraging the high-privilege tokens associated with 
  winlogon.exe. If confirmed malicious, this could allow the attacker to gain 
  elevated access, potentially leading to full system compromise and persistent 
  control over the affected host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 10
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=10  TargetImage IN("*\\system32\\winlogon.exe*", "*\\SysWOW64\\winlogon.exe*")
  AND GrantedAccess = 0x1040 AND NOT (SourceImage IN("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program
  File*", "%systemroot%\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by CallTrace EventID GrantedAccess Guid Opcode ProcessID SecurityID SourceImage
  SourceProcessGUID SourceProcessId TargetImage TargetProcessGUID TargetProcessId
  UserID dest granted_access parent_process_exec parent_process_guid parent_process_id
  parent_process_name parent_process_path process_exec process_guid process_id process_name
  process_path signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_access_token_winlogon_duplicate_handle_in_uncommon_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting 
  data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint 
  data model in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at 
  least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: It is possible legitimate applications will request 
  access to winlogon, filter as needed.
