description: The following analytic detects the creation of scheduled tasks designed
  to execute commands using native Windows shells like PowerShell, Cmd, Wscript, or
  Cscript or from public folders such as Users, Temp, or ProgramData. It leverages
  Windows Security EventCode 4698, 4700, and 4702 to identify when such tasks are
  registered, enabled, or modified. This activity is significant as it may indicate
  an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious commands on a system. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to maintain access, execute arbitrary
  code, or escalate privileges, posing a severe threat to the environment.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate applications are
  allowed to register tasks that call a shell to be spawned. Filter as needed based
  on command-line or processes that are used legitimately. Windows Defender, Google
  Chrome, and MS Edge updates may trigger this detection.
