description: This analytic detects attempts to create an "ESX Admins" group using
  PowerShell commands. This activity may indicate an attempt to exploit the VMware
  ESXi Active Directory Integration Authentication Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-37085).
  Attackers can use this method to gain unauthorized access to ESXi hosts by recreating
  the 'ESX Admins' group after its deletion from Active Directory.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. You can find additional
  setup instructions in the Splunk documentation for configuring PowerShell logging.
known_false_positives: Legitimate administrators might create an "ESX Admins" group
  for valid reasons. Verify that the group creation is authorized and part of normal
  administrative tasks. Consider the context of the action, such as the user performing
  it and any related activities.
