description: The following analytic detects the creation of archived files in a temporary
  folder, which may contain collected data. This behavior is often associated with
  malicious activity, where attackers compress sensitive information before exfiltration.
  The detection focuses on monitoring specific directories, such as temp folders,
  for the presence of newly created archive files (e.g., .zip, .rar, .tar). By identifying
  this pattern, security teams can quickly respond to potential data collection and
  exfiltration attempts, minimizing the risk of data breaches and improving overall
  threat detection.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
