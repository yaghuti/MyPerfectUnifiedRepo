description: The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator
  in PowerShell to query Active Directory for root domain linked policies. It leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this activity. This
  behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt by adversaries or Red Teams
  to gain situational awareness and perform Active Directory Discovery. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could allow attackers to map out domain policies, potentially
  aiding in further exploitation or lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*[adsisearcher]*" ScriptBlockText
  = "*.SearchRooT*" ScriptBlockText = "*.gplink*" | fillnull | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id user_id vendor_product
  EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_root_domain_linked_policies_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
