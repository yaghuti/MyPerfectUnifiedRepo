description:
  The following analytic detects the use of PowerShell environment variables
  to identify the current logged user by leveraging PowerShell Script Block Logging
  (EventCode=4104). This method monitors script blocks containing `$env:UserName`
  or `[System.Environment]::UserName`. Identifying this activity is significant as
  adversaries and Red Teams may use it for situational awareness and Active Directory
  discovery on compromised endpoints. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  allow attackers to gain insights into user context, aiding in further exploitation
  and lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  Administrators or power users may use this PowerShell commandlet
  for troubleshooting.
