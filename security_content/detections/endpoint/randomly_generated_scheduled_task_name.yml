description: The following analytic detects the creation of a Scheduled Task 
  with a high entropy, randomly generated name, leveraging Event ID 4698. It 
  uses the `ut_shannon` function from the URL ToolBox Splunk application to 
  measure the entropy of the Task Name. This activity is significant as 
  adversaries often use randomly named Scheduled Tasks for lateral movement and 
  remote code execution, employing tools like Impacket or CrackMapExec. If 
  confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code 
  remotely, potentially leading to further compromise and persistence within the
  network.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4698
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4698 | xmlkv Message | lookup ut_shannon_lookup
  word as Task_Name | where ut_shannon > 3 | table  _time, dest, Task_Name, ut_shannon,
  Command, Author, Enabled, Hidden | `randomly_generated_scheduled_task_name_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows
  TA as well as the URL ToolBox application are also required.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may use random Scheduled Task 
  names.
