description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `auditpol.exe` with
  the "/set" command-line argument in order to disable a specific category or sub-category
  from the audit policy. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity can
  be significant as it indicates potential defense evasion by adversaries or Red Teams,
  aiming to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to bypass defenses, and plan further
  attacks, potentially leading to full machine compromise or lateral movement.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process name, and process original file name.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be rare, investigate the activity, and
  apply additional filters when necessary.
