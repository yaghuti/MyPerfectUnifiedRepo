name: Linux Auditd Possible Access Or Modification Of Sshd Config File

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects suspicious access or modification of the
  sshd_config file on Linux systems. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing
  on command-line executions involving processes like "cat," "nano," "vim," and "vi"
  accessing the sshd_config file. This activity is significant because unauthorized
  changes to sshd_config can allow threat actors to redirect port connections or use
  unauthorized keys, potentially compromising the system. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or persistent backdoor
  access, posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Path
search: '`linux_auditd` type=PATH name="/etc/ssh/ssh_config*" 
  | rename host as dest
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime 
  by name nametype ogid type dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |  `linux_auditd_possible_access_or_modification_of_sshd_config_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
