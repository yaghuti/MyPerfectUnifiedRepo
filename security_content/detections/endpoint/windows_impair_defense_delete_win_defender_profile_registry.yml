description: The following analytic detects the deletion of the Windows Defender main
  profile registry key. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically
  monitoring for deleted actions within the Windows Defender registry path. This activity
  is significant as it indicates potential tampering with security defenses, often
  associated with Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and other malware. If confirmed malicious,
  this action could allow an attacker to disable Windows Defender, reducing the system's
  ability to detect and respond to further malicious activities, thereby compromising
  endpoint security.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path = "*\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows
  Defender" Registry.action = deleted by Registry.action Registry.dest Registry.process_guid
  Registry.process_id Registry.registry_hive Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_key_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_impair_defense_delete_win_defender_profile_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: It is unusual to turn this feature off a Windows system since
  it is a default security control, although it is not rare for some policies to disable
  it. Although no false positives have been identified, use the provided filter macro
  to tune the search.
