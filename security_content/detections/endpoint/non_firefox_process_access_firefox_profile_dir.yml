description: The following analytic detects non-Firefox processes accessing the 
  Firefox profile directory, which contains sensitive user data such as login 
  credentials, browsing history, and cookies. It leverages Windows Security 
  Event logs, specifically event code 4663, to monitor access attempts. This 
  activity is significant because it may indicate attempts by malware, such as 
  RATs or trojans, to harvest user information. If confirmed malicious, this 
  behavior could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized access to user 
  accounts, and further compromise of the affected system.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4663
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 NOT (ProcessName IN ("*\\firefox.exe",
  "*\\explorer.exe", "*sql*")) ObjectName="*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ObjectName ObjectType
  ProcessName AccessMask EventCode dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `non_firefox_process_access_firefox_profile_dir_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows
  Security Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object 
  Access" in Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" 
  and "Failure."
known_false_positives: other browser not listed related to firefox may catch by 
  this rule.
