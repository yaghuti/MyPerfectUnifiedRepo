description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of a PowerShell script that
  modifies the 'TrustedHosts' configuration via EventCode 4104. It leverages PowerShell
  Script Block Logging to identify commands targeting WSMan settings, specifically
  those altering or concatenating trusted hosts. This activity is significant as it
  can indicate attempts to manipulate remote connection settings, potentially allowing
  unauthorized remote access. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers
  to establish persistent remote connections, bypass security protocols, and gain
  unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

  '`powershell` EventCode=4104  ScriptBlockText = "*WSMan:\\localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts*"
  ScriptBlockText IN ("* -Value *", "* -Concatenate *") | fillnull | stats count min(_time)

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  user and network administrator may used this function to add
  trusted host.
