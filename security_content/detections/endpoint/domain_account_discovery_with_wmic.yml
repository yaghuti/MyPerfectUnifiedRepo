description: The following analytic detects the execution of `wmic.exe` with 
  command-line arguments used to query for domain users. It leverages data from 
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific 
  command-line patterns indicative of domain account discovery. This activity is
  significant as it often precedes lateral movement or privilege escalation 
  attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow 
  attackers to map out user accounts within the domain, facilitating further 
  attacks and potentially compromising sensitive information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint 
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide 
  security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To
  implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, 
  process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete 
  command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate 
  Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must 
  also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the 
  Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed 
  up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for 
  troubleshooting.
