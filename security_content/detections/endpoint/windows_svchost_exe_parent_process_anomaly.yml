name: Windows Svchost.exe Parent Process Anomaly

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects an anomaly where an svchost.exe process is spawned by a parent process other than the standard services.exe. In a typical Windows environment, svchost.exe is a system process that hosts Windows service DLLs, and is expected to be a child of services.exe. A process deviation from this hierarchy may indicate suspicious behavior, such as malicious code attempting to masquerade as a legitimate system process or evade detection. It is essential to investigate the parent process and associated behavior for further signs of compromise or unauthorized activity.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Windows Update or other Windows Installer processes may launch their own svchost.exe processes that are not directly spawned by services.exe in certain edge cases (e.g., during patches or updates).
