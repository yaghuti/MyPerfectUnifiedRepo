description: The following analytic detects the use of COM objects like CMLUA or CMSTPLUA
  to bypass User Account Control (UAC). It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify
  the loading of specific DLLs (CMLUA.dll, CMSTPLUA.dll, CMLUAUTIL.dll) by processes
  not typically associated with these libraries. This activity is significant as it
  indicates an attempt to gain elevated privileges, a common tactic used by ransomware
  adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute code
  with administrative rights, leading to potential system compromise and further malicious
  activities.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  ImageLoaded IN ("*\\CMLUA.dll", "*\\CMSTPLUA.dll",
  "*\\CMLUAUTIL.dll") NOT(process_name IN("CMSTP.exe", "CMMGR32.exe")) NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\*",
  "*\\program files*")) | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded dest loaded_file loaded_file_path original_file_name
  process_exec process_guid process_hash process_id process_name process_path service_dll_signature_exists
  service_dll_signature_verified signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `cmlua_or_cmstplua_uac_bypass_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Legitimate windows application that are not on the list loading
  this dll. Filter as needed.
