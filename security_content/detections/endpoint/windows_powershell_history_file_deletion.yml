name: Windows Powershell History File Deletion

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the usage of PowerShell to delete its command history file, which may indicate an attempt to evade detection by removing evidence of executed commands. PowerShell stores command history in ConsoleHost_history.txt under the userâ€™s profile directory. Adversaries or malicious scripts may delete this file using Remove-Item, del, or similar commands. This detection focuses on file deletion events targeting the history file, correlating them with recent PowerShell activity. While legitimate users may occasionally clear history, frequent or automated deletions should be investigated for potential defense evasion or post-exploitation cleanup activities.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Remove-Item*" ScriptBlockText = "*.HistorySavePath" | fillnull
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
