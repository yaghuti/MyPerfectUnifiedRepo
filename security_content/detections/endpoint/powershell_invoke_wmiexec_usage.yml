  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the Invoke-WMIExec utility
  within PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104). This detection leverages
  PowerShell script block logs to identify instances where the Invoke-WMIExec command
  is used. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it indicates potential lateral movement
  using WMI commands with NTLMv2 pass-the-hash authentication. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow an attacker to execute commands remotely on target systems,
  potentially leading to further compromise and lateral spread within the network.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://help.splunk.com/en/security-offerings/splunk-user-behavior-analytics/get-data-in/5.4.1/add-other-data-to-splunk-uba/configure-powershell-logging-to-see-powershell-anomalies-in-splunk-uba.
known_false_positives:
  False positives should be limited as this analytic is designed
  to detect a specific utility. It is recommended to apply appropriate filters as
  needed to minimize the number of false positives.
