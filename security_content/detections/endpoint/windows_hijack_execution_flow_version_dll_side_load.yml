description: The following analytic detects a process loading a version.dll file from
  a directory other than %windir%\system32 or %windir%\syswow64. This detection leverages
  Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify instances where an unsigned or improperly located
  version.dll is loaded. This activity is significant as it is a common technique
  used in ransomware and APT malware campaigns, including Brute Ratel C4, to execute
  malicious code via DLL side loading. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence, and potentially compromise the
  target host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 ImageLoaded = "*\\version.dll" AND (Signed = "false"
  OR NOT(ImageLoaded IN("*\\windows\\system32*",  "*\\windows\\syswow64\\*"))) | fillnull
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded
  dest loaded_file loaded_file_path original_file_name process_exec process_guid process_hash

  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_hijack_execution_flow_version_dll_side_load_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
  will add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to
  work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
