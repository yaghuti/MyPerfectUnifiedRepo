description: |
  This detection identifies execution of the file synchronization utility "rclone".
  It leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module logs, specifically flow data in order to capture process executions
  initiating network connections.
  While rclone is a legitimate command-line tool for syncing data to cloud storage providers, it has been widely abused by threat actors for data exfiltration.
  This analytic inspects process name and arguments for rclone and flags usage of suspicious flags.
  If matched, this could indicate malicious usage for stealthy data exfiltration or cloud abuse.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  Rclone is used legitimately in some backup or other workflows. Tune this rule based on known-good operational usage or restrict by known user/service accounts an specific folders or remote names.
