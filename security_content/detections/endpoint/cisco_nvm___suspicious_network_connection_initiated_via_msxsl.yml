description: |
  This analytic identifies the use of `msxsl.exe` initiating a network connection to a non-private IP address.
  Although `msxsl.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft utility used to apply XSLT transformations, adversaries can abuse it
  to execute arbitrary code or load external resources in an evasive manner.
  This detection leverages Cisco NVM telemetry to identify potentially malicious use of `msxsl.exe` making network connections
  that may indicate command and control (C2) or data exfiltration activity.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  False positives may occur in development or administrative environments where msxsl.exe is used
  for legitimate XML transformations. However, its use is uncommon in standard user activity
  and should be reviewed in most environments.
