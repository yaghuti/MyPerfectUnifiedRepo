description: The following analytic detects the presence of "api.telegram.org" 
  in the CommandLine of a process. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include 
  command-line details. This activity can be significant as the telegram API has
  been used as an exfiltration mechanism or even as a C2 channel. If confirmed 
  malicious, this could allow an attacker or malware to exfiltrate data or 
  receive additional C2 instruction, potentially leading to further compromise 
  and persistence within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint 
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide 
  security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To
  implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, 
  process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete 
  command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate 
  Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must 
  also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the 
  Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed 
  up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positive may stem from application or users 
  requesting the API directly via CommandLine for testing purposes. Investigate 
  the matches and apply the necessary filters.
