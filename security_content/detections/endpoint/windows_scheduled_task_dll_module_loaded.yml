description: The following analytic detects instances where the taskschd.dll is loaded
  by processes running in suspicious or writable directories. This activity is unusual,
  as legitimate processes that load taskschd.dll typically reside in protected system
  locations. Malware or threat actors may attempt to load this DLL from writable or
  non-standard directories to manipulate the Task Scheduler and execute malicious
  tasks. By identifying processes that load taskschd.dll in these unsafe locations,
  this detection helps security analysts flag potentially malicious activity and investigate
  further to prevent unauthorized system modifications.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Third party Legitimate application may load this task schedule
  dll module.
