name: Linux Auditd Find Credentials From Password Stores

description: The following analytic detects suspicious attempts to find credentials
  stored in password stores, indicating a potential attacker's effort to access sensitive
  login information. Password stores are critical repositories that contain valuable
  credentials, and unauthorized access to them can lead to significant security breaches.
  By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized activities related to password store access,
  this analytic helps identify potential credential theft attempts, allowing security
  teams to respond promptly and prevent unauthorized access to critical systems and
  data.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` execve_command IN ("*find*", "*grep*") AND execve_command IN ("*password*", "*pass *", "*credential*", "*creds*")
  | rename host as dest 
  | rename comm as process_name 
  | rename exe as process 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by argc execve_command dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_auditd_find_credentials_from_password_stores_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures
  command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should
  be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
