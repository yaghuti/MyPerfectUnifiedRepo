description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications or new entries
  in the Print Processor registry path. It leverages registry activity data from the
  Endpoint data model to identify changes in the specified registry path. This activity
  is significant because the Print Processor registry is known to be exploited by
  APT groups like Turla for persistence and privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to execute a malicious DLL payload by restarting the
  spoolsv.exe process, leading to potential control over the compromised machine.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: possible new printer installation may add driver component
  on this registry.
