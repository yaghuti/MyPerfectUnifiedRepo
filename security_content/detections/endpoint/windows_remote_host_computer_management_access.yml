description: The following analytic detects the use of mmc.exe to launch Computer Management (compmgmt.msc) and connect to a remote machine. This technique allows administrators to access system management tools, including Event Viewer, Services, Shared Folders, and Local Users & Groups, without initiating a full remote desktop session. While commonly used for legitimate administrative purposes, adversaries may leverage this method for remote reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or persistence. Monitoring the execution of mmc.exe with the /computer:{hostname/ip} argument can help detect unauthorized system administration attempts or lateral movement within a network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrator or power user can execute command shell or script to access Windows Remote Management.
