description:
  The following analytic detects the use of PowerShell's Invoke-RestMethod
  cmdlet to collect geolocation data from ipinfo.io or IP address information from
  api.ipify.org. This behavior leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging to identify
  scripts that gather external IP information and potential geolocation data. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate reconnaissance efforts, where threat
  actors are attempting to determine the geographical location or network details
  of a compromised system. While some legitimate software may use these services,
  this pattern is commonly observed in malware and post-exploitation toolkits like
  those used by Water Gamayun threat actors.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText="*Invoke-RestMethod*" AND (ScriptBlockText="*ipinfo.io*"
  OR ScriptBlockText="*api.ipify.org*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  Some legitimate applications or administrative scripts may
  use these services for IP validation or geolocation. Filter as needed for approved
  administrative tools.
