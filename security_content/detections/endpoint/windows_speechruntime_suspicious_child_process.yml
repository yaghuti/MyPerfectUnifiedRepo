description: SpeechRuntime is vulnerable to an attack that allows a user to run code on another user's 
  session remotely and stealthily by exploiting a Windows COM class. When this class 
  is invoked, it launches SpeechRuntime.exe in the context of the currently logged-on user. Because this 
  COM class is susceptible to COM Hijacking, the attacker can alter the registry remotely to point to a 
  malicious DLL. By dropping that DLL on the target system (e.g., via SMB) and triggering the COM object, 
  the attacker causes the malicious DLL to load into SpeechRuntime.exe and executing under the user's context. 
  This detection identifies suspicious child processes of SpeechRuntime.exe that could indicate abuse 
  of this vulnerability.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: This process should normally never be spawning these child processes.
