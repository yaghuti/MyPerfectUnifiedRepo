description: The following analytic detects the writing of data with an IMPHASH value
  to an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in the NTFS file system. It leverages Sysmon Event
  ID 15 and regex to identify files with a Portable Executable (PE) structure. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate a threat actor staging malicious code
  in hidden areas for persistence or future execution. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow attackers to execute hidden code, maintain persistence, or escalate
  privileges within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 15
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=15 IMPHASH!=00000000000000000000000000000000 | regex TargetFilename="(?<!\/)\b\w+(\.\w+)?:\w+(\.\w+)?$"
  | eval file_name = replace(TargetFilename,"(.*\\\)",""), process = Image , file_path
  = TargetFilename, file_hash = coalesce(SHA256,SHA1,MD5,Hash) | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest dvc file_hash file_name file_path process_exec
  process_guid process_id process_name process_path signature signature_id user_id
  vendor_product Contents Image | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_alternate_datastream___executable_content_filter`'
how_to_implement: Target environment must ingest Sysmon data, specifically Event ID
  15, and import hashing/imphash must be enabled within Sysmon.
