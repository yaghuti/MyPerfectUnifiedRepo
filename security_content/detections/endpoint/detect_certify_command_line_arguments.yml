description: The following analytic detects the use of Certify or Certipy tools to
  enumerate Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) environments. It leverages
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on specific command-line arguments
  associated with these tools. This activity is significant because it indicates potential
  reconnaissance or exploitation attempts targeting AD CS, which could lead to unauthorized
  access or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain insights
  into the AD CS infrastructure, potentially compromising sensitive certificates and
  escalating their privileges within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
