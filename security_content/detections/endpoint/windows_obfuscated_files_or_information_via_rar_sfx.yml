description: The following analytic detects the creation of RAR Self-Extracting (SFX)
  files by monitoring the generation of file related to rar sfx .tmp file creation
  during sfx installation. This method leverages a heuristic to identify RAR SFX archives
  based on specific markers that indicate a combination of executable code and compressed
  RAR data. By tracking such activity, the analytic helps pinpoint potentially unauthorized
  or suspicious file creation events, which are often associated with malware packaging
  or data exfiltration. Legitimate usage may include custom installers or compressed
  file delivery.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 TargetFilename IN ("*__tmp_rar_sfx_access_check*")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by action dest file_name
  file_path  process_guid process_id user user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_obfuscated_files_or_information_via_rar_sfx_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, TargetFilename, and eventcode 11 executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where rar sfx executable may be used.
known_false_positives: It can detect a third part utility software tool compiled to
  rar sfx.
