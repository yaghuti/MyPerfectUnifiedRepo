name: Linux Auditd Find Credentials From Password Managers

description: The following analytic detects suspicious attempts to find credentials
  stored in password managers, which may indicate an attacker's effort to retrieve
  sensitive login information. Password managers are often targeted by adversaries
  seeking to access stored passwords for further compromise or lateral movement within
  a network. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized access to password manager
  files or processes, this analytic helps identify potential credential theft attempts,
  enabling security teams to respond quickly to protect critical accounts and prevent
  further unauthorized access.

how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
