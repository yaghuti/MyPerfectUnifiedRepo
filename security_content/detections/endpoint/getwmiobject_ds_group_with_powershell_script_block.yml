description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-WmiObject` commandlet
  with the `DS_Group` parameter via PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104).
  This method leverages WMI to query all domain groups. Monitoring this activity is
  crucial as adversaries and Red Teams may use it for domain group enumeration, aiding
  in situational awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow attackers to map out the domain structure, potentially
  leading to further exploitation and privilege escalation within the network.
