name: Powershell COM Hijacking InprocServer32 Modification

description: The following analytic detects attempts to modify or add a Component
  Object Model (COM) entry to the InProcServer32 path within the registry using PowerShell.
  It leverages PowerShell ScriptBlock Logging (EventCode 4104) to identify suspicious
  script blocks that target the InProcServer32 registry path. This activity is significant
  because modifying COM objects can be used for persistence or privilege escalation
  by attackers. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
  code or maintain persistent access to the compromised system, posing a severe security
  risk.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\*\\InProcServer32*"
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID
  ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_com_hijacking_inprocserver32_modification_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following analytic requires PowerShell operational logs to be
  imported. Modify the PowerShell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or add index.
  This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present if any scripts are adding to
  inprocserver32. Filter as needed.
