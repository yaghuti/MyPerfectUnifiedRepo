description: The following analytic detects potentially suspicious modifications to
  the Audit Policy auditing options registry values. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  data model, focusing on changes to one of the following auditing option values "CrashOnAuditFail",
  "FullPrivilegeAuditing", "AuditBaseObjects" and "AuditBaseDirectories" within the
  "HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\" registry key. This activity is
  significant as it could be a sign of a threat actor trying to tamper with the audit
  policy configuration, and disabling SACLs configuration. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could allow attackers to bypass defenses, and plan further attacks,
  potentially leading to full machine compromise or lateral movement.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the official
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives: Active setup installer may add or modify this registry.
