description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-DomainGroup`
  cmdlet using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This cmdlet, part
  of the PowerView tool, is used to enumerate domain groups within a Windows domain.
  The detection leverages script block text to identify this specific command. Monitoring
  this activity is crucial as it may indicate an adversary or Red Team performing
  reconnaissance to gain situational awareness and map out Active Directory structures.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to further exploitation, including
  privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
