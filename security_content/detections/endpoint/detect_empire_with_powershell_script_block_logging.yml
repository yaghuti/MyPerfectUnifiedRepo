description:
  The following analytic detects suspicious PowerShell execution indicative
  of PowerShell-Empire activity. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104)
  to capture and analyze commands sent to PowerShell, specifically looking for patterns
  involving `system.net.webclient` and base64 encoding. This behavior is significant
  as it often represents initial stagers used by PowerShell-Empire, a known post-exploitation
  framework. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to download
  and execute additional payloads, leading to potential code execution, data exfiltration,
  or further compromise of the affected system.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104  (ScriptBlockText=*system.net.webclient* AND
  ScriptBlockText=*frombase64string*) | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID
  Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detect_empire_with_powershell_script_block_logging_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  False positives may only pertain to it not being related to
  Empire, but another framework. Filter as needed if any applications use the same
  pattern.
