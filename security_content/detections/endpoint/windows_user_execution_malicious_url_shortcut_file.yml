description: The following analytic detects the creation URL shortcut files, often
  used by malware like CHAOS ransomware. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem datamodel
  to identify ".url" files created outside common directories, such as "Program Files".
  This activity can be significant as ".URL" files can be used as mean to trick the
  user into visiting certain websites unknowingly, or when placed in certain locations
  such as "\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\",
  it may allow the execution of malicious code upon system reboot. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow an attacker to achieve persistence and execute harmful payloads,
  potentially leading to further system compromise and data loss.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow creation of script or exe in this
  path.
