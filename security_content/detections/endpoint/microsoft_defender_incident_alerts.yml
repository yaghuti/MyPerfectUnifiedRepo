- MS365 Defender Incident Alerts
description: The following analytic is to leverage alerts from Microsoft Defender O365 Incidents. This query aggregates and summarizes all alerts from Microsoft Defender O365 Incidents, providing details such as the destination, file name, severity, process command line, ip address, registry key, signature, description, unique id, and timestamps. This detection is not intended to detect new activity from raw data, but leverages Microsoft provided alerts to be correlated with other data as part of risk based alerting. The data contained in the alert is mapped not only to the risk obejct, but also the threat object. This detection filters out evidence that has a verdict of clean from Microsoft. It dynamically maps the MITRE technique at search time to auto populate the annotation field with the value provided in the alert. It also uses a static mapping to set the risk score based on the severity of the alert.

how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, you need to ingest alerts data from Microsoft Defender, specifcally using the Splunk add-on for Microsfot Security. This add-on will collect alerts using the ms365:defender:incident:alerts sourcetype. You will need to define the `ms365_defender_incident_alerts` macro to point to the proper index that contains the ms365:defender:incident:alerts sourcetype.
known_false_positives: False positives may vary based on Microsfot Defender configuration; monitor and filter out the alerts that are not relevant to your environment.

  manual_test: We are dynamically creating the risk_score field based on the severity of the alert in the SPL and that supersedes the risk score set in the detection. Setting these to manual test since otherwise we fail integration testing. The detection is also failing on unit-testing as some of the fields set in the observables are empty.
