description: This analytic detects instances where a user adds themselves to an Active
  Directory (AD) group. This activity is a common indicator of privilege escalation,
  where a user attempts to gain unauthorized access to higher privileges or sensitive
  resources. By monitoring AD logs, this detection identifies such suspicious behavior,
  which could be part of a larger attack strategy aimed at compromising critical systems
  and data.
