description: This detection identifies the use of attrib.exe to remove hidden (-h) or system (-s) attributes from the Default.rdp file, which is automatically created in a user's Documents folder when a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session is initiated using mstsc.exe. The Default.rdp file stores session configuration details such as the remote host address and screen settings. Unhiding this file is uncommon in normal user behavior and may indicate that an attacker or red team operator is attempting to access or manipulate RDP connection history that was previously hiddenâ€”either by default or as part of an earlier anti-forensics effort. This activity may represent part of a broader pattern of reconnaissance or staging for credential reuse, lateral movement, or forensic analysis evasion. Monitoring for this behavior can help uncover suspicious manipulation of user artifacts and highlight interactive attacker activity on a compromised host.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
