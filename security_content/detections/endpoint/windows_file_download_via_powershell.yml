description: |
  The following analytic detects the use of PowerShell's download methods such as
  "DownloadString" and "DownloadData" from the WebClient class or Invoke-WebRequest
  and it's aliases "IWR" or "Curl".
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process execution logs that include command-line details.
  This activity can be significant such methods and functions are commonly used in malicious
  PowerShell scripts to fetch and execute remote code.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to download and run
  arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration,
  or further compromise of the affected system.

how_to_implement: |
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: |
  False positives may be present and filtering will need to occur
  by parent process or command line argument. It may be required to modify this query
  to an EDR product for more granular coverage.
