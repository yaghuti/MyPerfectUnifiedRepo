name: UAC Bypass With Colorui COM Object

type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects a potential UAC bypass using the colorui.dll
  COM Object. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify instances where colorui.dll
  is loaded by a process other than colorcpl.exe, excluding common system directories.
  This activity is significant because UAC bypass techniques are often used by malware,
  such as LockBit ransomware, to gain elevated privileges without user consent. If
  confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code with higher privileges,
  leading to further system compromise and persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 ImageLoaded="*\\colorui.dll" process_name != "colorcpl.exe"
  NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\*", "*\\program files*")) | fillnull | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded dest loaded_file loaded_file_path
  original_file_name process_exec process_guid process_hash process_id process_name
  process_path service_dll_signature_exists service_dll_signature_verified signature
  signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `uac_bypass_with_colorui_com_object_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: not so common. but 3rd part app may load this dll.
