description: The following analytic identifies the execution of `auditpol.exe` with
  the "/resourceSACL" flag, and either the "/clear" or "/remove" command-line arguments
  used to remove or clear the global object access audit policy. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and
  command-line executions. This activity can be significant as it indicates potential
  defense evasion by adversaries or Red Teams, aiming to limit data that can be leveraged
  for detections and audits. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers
  to bypass defenses, and plan further attacks, potentially leading to full machine
  compromise or lateral movement.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process name, and process original file name.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be rare to non existent. Any activity
  detected by this analytic should be investigated and approved or denied.
