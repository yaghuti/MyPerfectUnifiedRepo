description: The following analytic detects the use of Mimikatz command line parameters
  associated with pass-the-ticket attacks. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line patterns related to
  Kerberos ticket manipulation. This activity is significant because pass-the-ticket
  attacks allow adversaries to move laterally within an environment using stolen Kerberos
  tickets, bypassing normal access controls. If confirmed malicious, this could enable
  attackers to escalate privileges, access sensitive information, and maintain persistence
  within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although highly unlikely, legitimate applications may use the
  same command line parameters as Mimikatz.
