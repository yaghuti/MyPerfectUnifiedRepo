description: The following analytic identifies the execution of PowerShell scripts from the WindowsApps directory, which is a common technique used in malicious MSIX package execution. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process command lines and parent process paths. This activity is significant as adversaries have been observed using MSIX packages with embedded PowerShell scripts (particularly StartingScriptWrapper.ps1) to execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, establish persistence, or deliver malware while evading traditional detection mechanisms.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain process execution information, including process paths and command lines. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications installed via the Microsoft Store or MSIX packages may execute PowerShell scripts from the WindowsApps directory as part of their normal operation. Verify if the MSIX package is from a trusted source and signed by a trusted publisher before taking action. Look for additional suspicious activities like network connections to unknown domains or execution of known malicious payloads.
