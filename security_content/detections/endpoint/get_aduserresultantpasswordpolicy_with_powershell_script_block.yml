description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy`
  PowerShell cmdlet, which is used to obtain the password policy in a Windows domain.
  It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this activity.
  Monitoring this behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to enumerate
  domain policies, a common tactic used by adversaries for situational awareness and
  Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to understand password policies, aiding in further attacks such as password guessing
  or policy exploitation.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText="*Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy*"
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest

how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
