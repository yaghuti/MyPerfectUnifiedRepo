- Windows Event Log Security 4625
description: The following analytic identifies a source host failing to authenticate
  against a remote host with multiple users, potentially indicating a Password Spraying
  attack. It leverages Windows Event 4625 (failed logon attempts) and Logon Type 3
  (remote authentication) to detect this behavior. This activity is significant as
  it may represent an adversary attempting to gain initial access or elevate privileges
  within an Active Directory environment. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and further compromise of the network.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid users against
  a remote host is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive
  scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners, remote administration
  tools, missconfigyred systems, etc.
