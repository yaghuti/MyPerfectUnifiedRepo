description: The following analytic detects the execution of suspicious command-line
  arguments commonly associated with Conti ransomware, specifically targeting local
  drives and network shares for encryption. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line
  details. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential ransomware
  attack, which can lead to widespread data encryption and operational disruption.
  If confirmed malicious, the impact could be severe, resulting in data loss, system
  downtime, and potential ransom demands.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: 3rd party tool may have commandline parameter that can trigger
  this detection.
