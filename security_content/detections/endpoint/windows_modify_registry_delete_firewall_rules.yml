description:
  The following analytic detects a potential deletion of firewall rules,
  indicating a possible security breach or unauthorized access attempt. It identifies
  actions where firewall rules are removed using commands like netsh advfirewall firewall
  delete rule, which can expose the network to external threats by disabling critical
  security measures. Monitoring these activities helps maintain network integrity
  and prevent malicious attacks.
search:
  '`sysmon` EventCode=12 TargetObject = "*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\FirewallRules\\*"
  EventType=DeleteValue |  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the official
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives:
  network admin may add/remove/modify public inbound firewall
  rule that may cause this rule to be triggered.
