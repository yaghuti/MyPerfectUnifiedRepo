description: The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator
  in PowerShell to query Active Directory for domain users. It leverages PowerShell
  Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify script blocks containing `[adsisearcher]`,
  `objectcategory=user`, and `.findAll()`. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt by adversaries or Red Teams to enumerate domain users for situational
  awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this could lead
  to further reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within the
  network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*[adsisearcher]*" ScriptBlockText
  = "*objectcategory=user*" ScriptBlockText = "*.findAll()*" | fillnull | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id user_id
  vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `adsisearcher_account_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
