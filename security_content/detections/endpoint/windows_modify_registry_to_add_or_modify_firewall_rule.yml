description:
  The following analytic detects a potential addition or modification of
  firewall rules, signaling possible configuration changes or security policy adjustments.
  It tracks commands such as netsh advfirewall firewall add rule and netsh advfirewall
  firewall set rule, which may indicate attempts to alter network access controls.
  Monitoring these actions ensures the integrity of firewall settings and helps prevent
  unauthorized network access.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the official
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives:
  network admin may add/remove/modify public inbound firewall
  rule that may cause this rule to be triggered.
