description: The following analytic detects the use of GACUtil.exe to add a DLL into
  the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity
  is significant because adding a DLL to the GAC allows it to be called by any application,
  potentially enabling widespread code execution. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code across the operating system, leading
  to privilege escalation or persistent access.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if gacutil.exe is utilized day
  to day by developers. Filter as needed.
