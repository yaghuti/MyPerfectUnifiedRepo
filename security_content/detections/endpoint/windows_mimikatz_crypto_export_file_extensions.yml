description: The following analytic detects the creation of files with extensions
  commonly associated with the Mimikatz Crypto module. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem
  data model to identify specific file names indicative of certificate export activities.
  This behavior is significant as it may indicate the use of Mimikatz to export cryptographic
  keys, which is a common tactic for credential theft. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could allow an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive cryptographic material,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access and further compromise of the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_name IN ("*.keyx.rsa.pvk","*sign.rsa.pvk","*sign.dsa.pvk","*dsa.ec.p8k","*dh.ec.p8k",
  "*.pfx", "*.der") by Filesystem.action Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_access_time

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `windows_mimikatz_crypto_export_file_extensions_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and may need to be reviewed
  before this can be turned into a TTP. In addition, remove .pfx (standalone) if it's
  too much volume.
