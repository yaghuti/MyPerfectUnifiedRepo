description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-DomainController`
  commandlet using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This commandlet
  is part of PowerView, a tool often used for domain enumeration. The detection leverages
  script block text to identify this specific activity. Monitoring this behavior is
  crucial as it may indicate an adversary or Red Team performing reconnaissance to
  map out domain controllers. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to
  further domain enumeration, potentially exposing sensitive information and aiding
  in lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  Administrators or power users may use this PowerShell commandlet
  for troubleshooting.
