description: |
  The following analytic detects the use of Windows Curl.exe to download
  a file to a suspicious location, such as AppData, ProgramData, or Public directories.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  command-line executions that include the -O or --output options. This activity is
  significant because downloading files to these locations can indicate an attempt
  to bypass security controls or establish persistence. If confirmed malicious, this
  behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or further
  compromise of the system.

how_to_implement: |
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: |
  It is possible Administrators or super users will use Curl for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
