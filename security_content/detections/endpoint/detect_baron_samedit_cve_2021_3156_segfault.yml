name: Detect Baron Samedit CVE-2021-3156 Segfault
id: 10f2bae0-bbe6-4984-808c-37dc1c67980d
version: 6
date: '2025-05-02'
author: Shannon Davis, Splunk
status: experimental
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies a heap-based buffer overflow in sudoedit
  by detecting Linux logs containing both "sudoedit" and "segfault" terms. This detection
  leverages Splunk to monitor for more than five occurrences of these terms on a single
  host within a specified timeframe. This activity is significant because exploiting
  this vulnerability (CVE-2021-3156) can allow attackers to gain root privileges,
  leading to potential system compromise, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
  If confirmed malicious, this could result in elevated privileges and full control
  over the affected system, posing a severe security risk.
data_source: []
search: '`linux_hosts` TERM(sudoedit) TERM(segfault) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by host | where count > 5 | `detect_baron_samedit_cve_2021_3156_segfault_filter`'
how_to_implement: Splunk Universal Forwarder running on Linux systems (tested on Centos
  and Ubuntu), where segfaults are being logged.  This also captures instances where
  the exploit has been compiled into a binary. The detection looks for greater than
  5 instances of sudoedit combined with segfault over your search time period on a
  single host
known_false_positives: If sudoedit is throwing segfaults for other reasons this will
  pick those up too.
