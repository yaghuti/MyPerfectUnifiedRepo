description: The following analytic detects the creation of permanent event subscriptions
  using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). It leverages Sysmon EventID 5 data
  to identify instances where the event consumers are not the expected "NTEventLogEventConsumer."
  This activity is significant because it suggests an attacker is attempting to achieve
  persistence by running malicious scripts or binaries in response to specific system
  events. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to severe impacts such as data theft,
  ransomware deployment, or other damaging outcomes. Investigate the associated scripts
  or binaries to identify the source of the attack.
data_source: []
search: '`wmi` EventCode=5861 Binding | rex field=Message "Consumer =\s+(?<consumer>[^;|^$]+)"
  | search consumer!="NTEventLogEventConsumer=\"SCM Event Log Consumer\"" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName, consumer,
  Message | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | rename ComputerName as dest | `wmi_permanent_event_subscription_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting the
  Windows WMI activity logs. This can be done by adding a stanza to inputs.conf on
  the system generating logs with a title of [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational].
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, administrators may use event subscriptions
  for legitimate purposes.
