description: The following analytic identifies the bulk creation of ransomware 
  notes (e.g., .txt, .html, .hta files) on an infected machine. It leverages 
  Sysmon EventCode 11 to detect multiple instances of these file types being 
  created within a short time frame. This activity is significant as it often 
  indicates an active ransomware attack, where the attacker is notifying the 
  victim of the encryption. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to 
  widespread data encryption, rendering critical files inaccessible and 
  potentially causing significant operational disruption.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=11 file_name IN ("*\.txt","*\.html","*\.hta") | bin _time
  span=10s | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime dc(TargetFilename)
  as unique_readme_path_count values(TargetFilename) as list_of_readme_path values(action)
  as action values(file_access_time) as file_access_time values(file_create_time)
  as file_create_time values(file_hash) as file_hash values(file_modify_time) as file_modify_time
  values(file_path) as file_path values(file_acl) as file_acl values(file_size) as
  file_size values(process_guid) as process_guid values(process_id) as process_id
  values(user) as user values(vendor_product) as vendor_product by dest file_name
  | where unique_readme_path_count >= 15 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `ransomware_notes_bulk_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem 
  activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data model node.
  If you are using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each 
  endpoint from which you want to collect data.
