description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` running
  the `Get-DomainPolicy` cmdlet, which is used to retrieve password policies in a
  Windows domain. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to gather domain
  policy information, which is crucial for planning further attacks. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive domain configurations,
  aiding in privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
