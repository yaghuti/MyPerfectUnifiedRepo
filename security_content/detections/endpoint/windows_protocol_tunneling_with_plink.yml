description: This analytic detects the use of Plink (including renamed versions like
  pvhost.exe) for protocol tunneling, which may be used for egress or lateral movement
  within an organization. It identifies specific command-line options (-R, -L, -D,
  -l, -N, -P, -pw) commonly used for port forwarding and tunneling by analyzing process
  execution logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate an attempt to bypass network security controls
  or establish unauthorized connections. If confirmed malicious, this could allow
  an attacker to exfiltrate data, move laterally across the network, or maintain persistent
  access, posing a severe threat to the organization's security. The detection covers
  both the original Plink executable and potential renamed versions, enhancing its
  ability to catch evasion attempts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization allows for
  SSH tunneling outbound or internally. Filter as needed.
