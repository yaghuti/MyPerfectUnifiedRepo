status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects suspicious PowerShell activity via EventCode
  4104, where WMI performs event queries to gather information on running processes
  or services. This detection leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging to identify
  specific WMI queries targeting system information classes like Win32_Bios and Win32_OperatingSystem.
  This activity is significant as it often indicates reconnaissance efforts by an
  adversary to profile the compromised machine. If confirmed malicious, the attacker
  could gain detailed system information, aiding in further exploitation or lateral
  movement within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 AND ScriptBlockText IN ("*SELECT*", "*Get-WmiObject*")
  AND ScriptBlockText IN ("*Win32_Bios*", "*Win32_OperatingSystem*", "*Win32_Processor*",
  "*Win32_ComputerSystem*", "*Win32_PnPEntity*", "*Win32_ShadowCopy*", "*Win32_DiskDrive*",
  "*Win32_PhysicalMemory*", "*Win32_BaseBoard*", "*Win32_DisplayConfiguration*") |

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
