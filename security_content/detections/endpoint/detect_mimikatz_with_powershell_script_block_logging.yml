description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of Mimikatz commands via
  PowerShell by leveraging PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This
  method captures and logs the full command sent to PowerShell, allowing for the identification
  of suspicious activities such as Pass the Ticket, Pass the Hash, and credential
  dumping. This activity is significant as Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for
  credential theft and lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of sensitive
  information within the environment.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN (*mimikatz*, *-dumpcr*, *sekurlsa::pth*,
  *kerberos::ptt*, *kerberos::golden*) | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  False positives should be limited as the commands being identifies
  are quite specific to EventCode 4104 and Mimikatz. Filter as needed.
