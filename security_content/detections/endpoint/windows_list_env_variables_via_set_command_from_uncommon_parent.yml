description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process command line fetching
  environment variables using the cmd.exe "set" command, with a non-shell parent process.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  command-line executions and parent process names. This activity could be significant
  as it is commonly associated with malware like Qakbot, which uses this technique
  to gather system information. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate
  that the parent process has been compromised, potentially allowing attackers to
  execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: shell process that are not included in this search may cause
  False positive. Filter as needed.
