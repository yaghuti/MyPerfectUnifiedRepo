description: "The following analytic detects the process of logging off a user through\
  \ the use of the quser and logoff commands. By monitoring for these commands, the\
  \ analytic identifies actions where a user session is forcibly terminated, which\
  \ could be part of an administrative task or a potentially unauthorized access attempt.\
  \ This detection helps identify potential misuse or malicious activity where a user\u2019\
  s access is revoked without proper authorization, providing insight into potential\
  \ security incidents involving account management or session manipulation."

how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command.
