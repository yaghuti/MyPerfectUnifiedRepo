description: |
  The following analytic detects potentially suspicious file copy operations targeting the
  System32 or SysWow64 directories as source, often indicative of malicious activity.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, 
  focusing on activity initiated by command-line tools like cmd.exe or PowerShell.
  This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to evade defenses by copying
  an existing binary from the system directory and renaming it.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute
  code undetected and potentially leading to system compromise or further lateral movement
  within the network.

how_to_implement: |
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Copying files from System directories can happen for multiple admin reasons, allbeit rare without approval. Apply additional filters where needed.
