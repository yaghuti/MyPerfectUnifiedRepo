description: The following analytic detects the execution of known MailSniper PowerShell
  functions on a machine. It leverages PowerShell logs (EventCode 4104) to identify
  specific script block text associated with MailSniper activities. This behavior
  is significant as MailSniper is often used by attackers to harvest sensitive emails
  from compromised Exchange servers. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead
  to unauthorized access to sensitive email data, credential theft, and further compromise
  of the email infrastructure.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104

  "*Invoke-GlobalMailSearch*", "*Invoke-SelfSearch*", "*Invoke-PasswordSprayOWA*",

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the powershell logs  from your endpoints. make sure you enable needed
  registry to monitor this event.
