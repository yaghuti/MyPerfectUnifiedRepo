description: The following analytic detects the behavior of dumping credentials from
  memory by exploiting the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) using
  the comsvcs.dll and MiniDump via rundll32. This detection leverages process information
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs, focusing on specific command-line
  executions. This activity is significant because it indicates potential credential
  theft, which can lead to broader system compromise, persistence, lateral movement,
  and privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized
  access to sensitive information, leading to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other
  damaging outcomes.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: None identified.
