name: Kerberos Pre-Authentication Flag Disabled with PowerShell

description:
  The following analytic detects the use of the `Set-ADAccountControl`
  PowerShell cmdlet with parameters that disable Kerberos Pre-Authentication. It leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this specific command
  execution. Disabling Kerberos Pre-Authentication is significant because it allows
  adversaries to perform offline brute force attacks against user passwords using
  the AS-REP Roasting technique. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable
  attackers to escalate privileges or maintain persistence within an Active Directory
  environment, posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*Set-ADAccountControl*" AND
  ScriptBlockText="*DoesNotRequirePreAuth:$true*") | fillnull | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id user_id vendor_product
  EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `kerberos_pre_authentication_flag_disabled_with_powershell_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  Although unlikely, Administrators may need to set this flag
  for legitimate purposes.
