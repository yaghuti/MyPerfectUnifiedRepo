description: The following analytic detects the creation of files in the Windows
  %startup% folder, a common persistence technique. It leverages the 
  Endpoint.Filesystem data model to identify file creation events in this 
  specific directory. This activity is significant because adversaries often use
  the startup folder to ensure their malicious code executes automatically upon 
  system boot or user logon. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers 
  to maintain persistence on the host, potentially leading to further system 
  compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

search: '|tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path = "*\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start
  Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\*" by Filesystem.action Filesystem.dest Filesystem.file_access_time

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_boot_or_logon_autostart_execution_in_startup_folder_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting
  information on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for
  the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the 
  `Filesystem` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow creation of script or exe in 
  this path.
