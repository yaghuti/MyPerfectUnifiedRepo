description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of a suspicious rundll32
  command line used to clear the shim cache. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant because clearing the shim cache is an anti-forensic
  technique aimed at evading detection and removing forensic artifacts. If confirmed
  malicious, this action could hinder incident response efforts, allowing an attacker
  to cover their tracks and maintain persistence on the compromised machine.

how_to_implement:
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
