description:
  The following analytic detects the import of Windows PowerShell Applocker
  cmdlets, specifically identifying the use of "Import-Module Applocker" and "Set-AppLockerPolicy"
  with an XML policy. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode 4104)
  to capture and analyze script block text. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt to enforce restrictive Applocker policies, potentially used
  by malware like Azorult to disable antivirus products. If confirmed malicious, this
  could allow an attacker to bypass security controls, leading to further system compromise
  and persistence.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText="*Import-Module Applocker*" ScriptBlockText="*Set-AppLockerPolicy*"
  ScriptBlockText="* -XMLPolicy *" | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_powershell_import_applocker_policy_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
