description: |
  The following analytic detects any outbound network connection from an endpoint process to a known suspicious or non-standard port.
  It leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module flow data logs to identify potentially suspicious behavior by looking at processes
  communicating over ports like 4444, 2222, or 51820 are commonly used by tools like Metasploit, SliverC2 or other pentest, red team or malware.
  These connections are worth investigating further, especially when initiated by unexpected or non-network-native binaries.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  Some legitimate applications may use high or non-standard ports, such as alternate SSH daemons or development tools.
  However, many of these ports are commonly used by threat actors for reverse shells or C2 communications.
  Review the associated process and command-line context to determine intent.
