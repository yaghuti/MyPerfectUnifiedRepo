description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the Get-DomainTrust command
  from PowerView using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This method
  captures the full command sent to PowerShell, allowing for detailed inspection.
  Identifying this activity is significant because it may indicate an attempt to gather
  domain trust information, which is often a precursor to lateral movement or privilege
  escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable an attacker to map
  trust relationships within the domain, potentially leading to further exploitation
  and compromise of additional systems.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*get-domaintrust*" | fillnull
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id
  user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `get_domaintrust_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  It is possible certain system management frameworks utilize
  this command to gather trust information.
