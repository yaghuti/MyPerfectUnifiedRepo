- Windows Event Log Security 4663
description: The following analytic identifies non-Chrome processes accessing 
  the Chrome user data file "login data." This file is an SQLite database 
  containing sensitive information, including saved passwords. The detection 
  leverages Windows Security Event logs, specifically event code 4663, to 
  monitor access attempts. This activity is significant as it may indicate 
  attempts by threat actors to extract and decrypt stored passwords, posing a 
  risk to user credentials. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain 
  unauthorized access to sensitive accounts and escalate their privileges within
  the environment.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4663 object_file_path="*\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User
  Data\\Default\\Login Data" AND NOT (process_path IN ("*:\\Windows\\explorer.exe",
  "*:\\Windows\\System32\\dllhost.exe", "*\\chrome.exe")) | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by object_file_name object_file_path process_name

  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_credentials_from_password_stores_chrome_login_data_access_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows
  Security Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object 
  Access" in Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" 
  and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall application may access this registry to remove 
  the entry of the target application. filter is needed.
