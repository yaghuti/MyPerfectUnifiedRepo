description: The following analytic identifies processes launching netsh.exe, a command-line
  utility used to modify network configurations. It detects this activity by analyzing
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process GUIDs,
  names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This behavior is significant
  because netsh.exe can be exploited to execute malicious helper DLLs, serving as
  a persistence mechanism. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain persistent
  access, modify network settings, and potentially escalate privileges, posing a severe
  threat to the network's integrity and security.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some VPN applications are known to launch netsh.exe. Outside
  of these instances, it is unusual for an executable to launch netsh.exe and run
  commands.
