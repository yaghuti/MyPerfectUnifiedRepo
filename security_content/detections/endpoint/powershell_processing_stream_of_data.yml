description:
  The following analytic detects suspicious PowerShell script execution
  involving compressed stream data processing, identified via EventCode 4104. It leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging to flag scripts using `IO.Compression`, `IO.StreamReader`,
  or decompression methods. This activity is significant as it often indicates obfuscated
  PowerShell or embedded .NET/binary execution, which are common tactics for evading
  detection. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute
  hidden code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*IO.Compression.*" OR ScriptBlockText
  = "*IO.StreamReader*" OR ScriptBlockText = "*]::Decompress*" | fillnull | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id
  user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `powershell_processing_stream_of_data_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
