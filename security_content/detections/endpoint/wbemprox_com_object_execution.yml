description: The following analytic detects a suspicious process loading a COM object
  from wbemprox.dll, fastprox.dll, or wbemcomn.dll. It leverages Sysmon EventCode
  7 to identify instances where these DLLs are loaded by processes not typically associated
  with them, excluding known legitimate processes and directories. This activity is
  significant as it may indicate an attempt by threat actors to abuse COM objects
  for privilege escalation or evasion of detection mechanisms. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges or maintain persistence within
  the environment, posing a significant security risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  ImageLoaded IN ("*\\fastprox.dll", "*\\wbemprox.dll",
  "*\\wbemcomn.dll") NOT (process_name IN ("wmiprvse.exe", "WmiApSrv.exe", "unsecapp.exe"))
  NOT(Image IN("*\\windows\\*","*\\program files*", "*\\wbem\\*")) | fillnull | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded dest loaded_file

  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wbemprox_com_object_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: legitimate process that are not in the exception list may trigger
  this event.
