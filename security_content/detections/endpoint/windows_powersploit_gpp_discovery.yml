  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the Get-GPPPassword PowerShell
  cmdlet, which is used to search for unsecured credentials in Group Policy Preferences
  (GPP). This detection leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging to identify specific
  script block text associated with this cmdlet. Monitoring this activity is crucial
  as it can indicate an attempt to retrieve and decrypt stored credentials from SYSVOL,
  potentially leading to unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network
  by exploiting exposed credentials.
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104  (ScriptBlockText=Get-GPPPassword OR ScriptBlockText=Get-CachedGPPPassword)
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
