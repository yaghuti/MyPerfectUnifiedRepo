description: |
  This analytic detects suspicious downloads from common file sharing and content delivery platforms using known living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins)
  such as 'curl.exe', 'certutil.exe', 'msiexec.exe', 'powershell.exe', 'wmic.exe', and others.
  It leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module logs to correlate network flow activity with process context, including command-line arguments, process path,
  and parent process information. These tools are often abused by adversaries and malware to retrieve payloads from public hosting platforms
  such as GitHub, Discord CDN, Transfer.sh, or Pastebin.
  This detection helps identify potential initial access, payload staging, or command and control activity using legitimate services.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  Some system administrators or development teams may use tools like curl or PowerShell to download files from public services
  for legitimate automation or scripting purposes. However, use of these binaries to contact domains commonly associated with file sharing or temporary hosting
  should be carefully reviewed, as such services are frequently abused by threat actors for malware delivery and staging.
  Tuning by domain allowlisting or internal usage policies is recommended.
