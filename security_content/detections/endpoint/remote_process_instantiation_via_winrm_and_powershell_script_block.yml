description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of PowerShell commands that
  use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to start a process on a remote endpoint via the
  WinRM protocol. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to
  identify such activities. This behavior is significant as it may indicate lateral
  movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on remote systems,
  potentially leading to further compromise and persistence within the network.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText="*Invoke-Command*" AND ScriptBlockText="*-ComputerName*")
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest

  | `remote_process_instantiation_via_winrm_and_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup instructions
  can be found https://help.splunk.com/en/security-offerings/splunk-user-behavior-analytics/get-data-in/5.4.1/add-other-data-to-splunk-uba/configure-powershell-logging-to-see-powershell-anomalies-in-splunk-uba.
known_false_positives:
  Administrators may leverage WinRM and `Invoke-Command` to start
  a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use cases. This
  activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users. In certain environments,
  tuning may not be possible.
