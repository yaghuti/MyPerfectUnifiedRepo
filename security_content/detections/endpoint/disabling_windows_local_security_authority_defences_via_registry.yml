description: The following analytic identifies the deletion of registry keys that
  disable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection and Microsoft Defender Device
  Guard. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on registry actions and paths associated with LSA and Device Guard settings. This
  activity is significant because disabling these defenses can leave a system vulnerable
  to various attacks, including credential theft and unauthorized code execution.
  If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to bypass critical security
  mechanisms, leading to potential system compromise and persistent access.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Potential to be triggered by an administrator disabling protections
  for troubleshooting purposes.
