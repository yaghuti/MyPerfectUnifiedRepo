name: Linux Auditd Nopasswd Entry In Sudoers File

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the addition of NOPASSWD entries to the
  /etc/sudoers file on Linux systems. It leverages Linux Auditd data to identify command
  lines containing "NOPASSWD:". This activity is significant because it allows users
  to execute commands with elevated privileges without requiring a password, which
  can be exploited by adversaries to maintain persistent, privileged access. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized privilege escalation, persistent access,
  and potential compromise of sensitive data and system integrity.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` proctitle = "*NOPASSWD*" | rename host as dest | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by  proctitle dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_auditd_nopasswd_entry_in_sudoers_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
