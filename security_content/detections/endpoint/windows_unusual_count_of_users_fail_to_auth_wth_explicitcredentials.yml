name: Windows Unusual Count Of Users Fail To Auth Wth ExplicitCredentials

data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4648
description: The following analytic identifies a source user failing to authenticate
  with multiple users using explicit credentials on a host. It leverages Windows Event
  Code 4648 and calculates the standard deviation for each host, using the 3-sigma
  rule to detect anomalies. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password
  Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege
  escalation, or further compromise of the Active Directory environment.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A source user failing attempting to authenticate multiple users
  on a host is not a common behavior for regular systems. Some applications, however,
  may exhibit this behavior in which case sets of users hosts can be added to an allow
  list. Possible false positive scenarios include systems where several users connect
  to like Mail servers, identity providers, remote desktop services, Citrix, etc.
