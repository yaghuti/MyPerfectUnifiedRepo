description: The following analytic detects the execution of wmic.exe with parameters
  to spawn a process on a remote system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process telemetry
  mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. This activity is significant
  as WMI can be abused for lateral movement and remote code execution, often used
  by adversaries and Red Teams. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary code on remote systems, facilitating further compromise and
  lateral spread within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: The wmic.exe utility is a benign Windows application. It may
  be used legitimately by Administrators with these parameters for remote system administration,
  but it's relatively uncommon.
