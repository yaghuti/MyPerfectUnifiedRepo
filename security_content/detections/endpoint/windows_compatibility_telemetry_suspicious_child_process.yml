description: The following analytic detects the execution of CompatTelRunner.exe with
  parameters indicative of a process not part of the normal "Microsoft Compatibility
  Appraiser" telemetry collection. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant because CompatTelRunner.exe and the "Microsoft Compatibility
  Appraiser" task always run as System and can be used to elevate privileges or establish
  a highly privileged persistence mechanism. If confirmed malicious, this could enable
  unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access to the compromised
  system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
