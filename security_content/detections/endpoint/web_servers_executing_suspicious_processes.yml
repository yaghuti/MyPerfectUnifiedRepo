description: The following analytic detects the execution of suspicious processes
  on systems identified as web servers. It leverages the Splunk data model "Endpoint.Processes"
  to search for specific process names such as "whoami", "ping", "iptables", "wget",
  "service", and "curl". This activity is significant because these processes are
  often used by attackers for reconnaissance, persistence, or data exfiltration. If
  confirmed malicious, this could lead to data theft, deployment of additional malware,
  or even ransomware attacks. Immediate investigation is required to determine the
  legitimacy of the activity and mitigate potential threats.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Some of these processes may be used legitimately on web servers
  during maintenance or other administrative tasks.
