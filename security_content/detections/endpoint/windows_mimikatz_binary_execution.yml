description: The following analytic identifies the execution of the native mimikatz.exe
  binary on Windows systems, including instances where the binary is renamed. It leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names
  and original file names. This activity is significant because Mimikatz is a widely
  used tool for extracting authentication credentials, posing a severe security risk.
  If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to obtain sensitive
  credentials, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network, leading
  to potential data breaches and system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as this is directly looking
  for Mimikatz, the credential dumping utility.
