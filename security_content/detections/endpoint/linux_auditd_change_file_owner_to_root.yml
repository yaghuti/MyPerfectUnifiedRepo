name: Linux Auditd Change File Owner To Root

description: The following analytic detects the use of the 'chown' command to change
  a file owner to 'root' on a Linux system. It leverages Linux Auditd telemetry, specifically
  monitoring command-line executions and process details. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate an attempt to escalate privileges by adversaries, malware, or
  red teamers. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow an attacker to gain
  root-level access, leading to full control over the compromised host and potential
  persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` proctitle = "*chown *root*"
  | rename host as dest 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by proctitle dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_auditd_change_file_owner_to_root_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures
  command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should
  be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
