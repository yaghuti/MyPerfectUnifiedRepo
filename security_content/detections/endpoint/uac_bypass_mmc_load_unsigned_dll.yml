description: The following analytic detects the loading of an unsigned DLL by the
  MMC.exe application, which is indicative of a potential UAC bypass or privilege
  escalation attempt. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify instances where
  MMC.exe loads a non-Microsoft, unsigned DLL. This activity is significant because
  attackers often use this technique to modify CLSID registry entries, causing MMC.exe
  to load malicious DLLs, thereby bypassing User Account Control (UAC) and gaining
  elevated privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute
  arbitrary code with higher privileges, leading to further system compromise and
  persistence.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  ImageLoaded = "*.dll" Image = "*\\mmc.exe" Signed=false
  Company != "Microsoft Corporation" | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded dest loaded_file loaded_file_path original_file_name

  service_dll_signature_verified signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `uac_bypass_mmc_load_unsigned_dll_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: unknown. all of the dll loaded by mmc.exe is microsoft signed
  dll.
