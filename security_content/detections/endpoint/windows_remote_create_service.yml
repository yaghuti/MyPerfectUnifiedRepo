description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a new service on a
  remote endpoint using sc.exe. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, specifically monitoring for EventCode 7045, which indicates a new
  service creation. This activity is significant as it may indicate lateral movement
  or remote code execution attempts by an attacker. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow the attacker to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary
  code on the remote system, potentially leading to further compromise of the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Note that false positives may occur, and filtering may be necessary,
  especially when it comes to remote service creation by administrators or software
  management utilities.
