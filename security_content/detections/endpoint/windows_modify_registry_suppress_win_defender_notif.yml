description:
  The following analytic detects modifications in the Windows registry
  to suppress Windows Defender notifications. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  datamodel, specifically targeting changes to the "Notification_Suppress" registry
  value. This activity is significant because adversaries, including those deploying
  Azorult malware, use this technique to bypass Windows Defender and disable critical
  notifications. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to evade
  detection, maintain persistence, and execute further malicious activities without
  alerting the user or security tools.
data_source:
  - Sysmon EventID 13
search:
  '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry where Registry.registry_path= "*\\Windows
  Defender\\UX Configuration\\Notification_Suppress*" Registry.registry_value_data="0x00000001"

  | `windows_modify_registry_suppress_win_defender_notif_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives:
  administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
