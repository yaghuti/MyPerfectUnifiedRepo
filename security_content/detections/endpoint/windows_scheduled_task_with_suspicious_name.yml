description: The following analytic detects the creation, modification, or 
  enabling of scheduled tasks with known suspicious or malicious task names. It 
  leverages Windows Security EventCode 4698, 4700, and 4702 to identify when 
  such tasks are registered, modified, or enabled. This activity is significant 
  as it may indicate an attempt to establish persistence or execute malicious 
  commands on a system. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to 
  maintain access, execute arbitrary code, or escalate privileges, posing a 
  severe threat to the environment.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4698
- Windows Event Log Security 4700
- Windows Event Log Security 4702
search: |-
  `wineventlog_security` EventCode IN (4698,4700,4702)
  | eval TaskContent = case(isnotnull(TaskContentNew),TaskContentNew,true(),TaskContent)
  | xmlkv TaskContent
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime latest(Arguments) as Arguments latest(Author) as Author by Computer, TaskName, Command, Enabled, Hidden,Caller_User_Name, EventCode
  | lookup windows_suspicious_tasks task_name as TaskName 
  | where isnotnull(tool_type)
  | eval command=TaskName, process=Command+if(isnotnull(Arguments)," ".Arguments,""), src_user=Author, user = Caller_User_Name, dest = Computer
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_scheduled_task_with_suspicious_name_filter`
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows
  TA is also required.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate applications 
  are allowed to register tasks that call a shell to be spawned. Filter as 
  needed based on command-line or processes that are used legitimately.
