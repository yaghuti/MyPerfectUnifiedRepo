description: The following analytic detects the creation of a batch file (.bat) within
  the Windows system directory tree, specifically in the System32 or SysWOW64 folders.
  It leverages data from the Endpoint datamodel, focusing on process and filesystem
  events to identify this behavior. This activity is significant because writing batch
  files to system directories can be indicative of malicious intent, such as persistence
  mechanisms or system manipulation. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, potentially compromising
  the entire system.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible for this search to generate a finding event
  for a batch file write to a path that includes the string "system32", but is not
  the actual Windows system directory. As such, you should confirm the path of the
  batch file identified by the search. In addition, a false positive may be generated
  by an administrator copying a legitimate batch file in this directory tree. You
  should confirm that the activity is legitimate and modify the search to add exclusions,
  as necessary.
