description: The following analytic detects when the Kerberos Pre-Authentication flag
  is disabled in a user account, using Windows Security Event 4738. This event indicates
  a change in the UserAccountControl property of a domain user object. Disabling this
  flag allows adversaries to perform offline brute force attacks on the user's password
  using the AS-REP Roasting technique. This activity is significant as it can be used
  by attackers with existing privileges to escalate their access or maintain persistence.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise
  of sensitive information.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `User Account
  Management` within `Account Management` needs to be enabled.
