description: The following analytic identifies the creation of suspicious .aspx files
  in known drop locations for Exchange exploitation, specifically targeting paths
  associated with HAFNIUM group and vulnerabilities like ProxyShell and ProxyNotShell.
  It leverages data from the Endpoint datamodel, focusing on process and filesystem
  events. This activity is significant as it may indicate a web shell deployment,
  a common method for persistent access and remote code execution. If confirmed malicious,
  attackers could gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially
  escalate privileges within the Exchange environment.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime 
  FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where Filesystem.file_path IN ("*\\HttpProxy\\owa\\auth\\*", "*\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\*", "*\\HttpProxy\\OAB\\*")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node and `Filesystem`
  node.
known_false_positives: The query is structured in a way that `action` (read, create)
  is not defined. Review the results of this query, filter, and tune as necessary.
  It may be necessary to generate this query specific to your endpoint product.
