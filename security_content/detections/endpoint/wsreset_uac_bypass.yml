description: The following analytic detects a suspicious modification of the registry
  aimed at bypassing User Account Control (UAC) by leveraging WSReset.exe. It identifies
  the creation or modification of specific registry values under the path "*\\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\\Shell\\open\\command*".
  This detection uses data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process and registry events. This activity is significant because UAC bypass
  techniques can allow attackers to execute high-privilege actions without user consent.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution and potential
  system compromise.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry
  WHERE Registry.registry_path= "*\\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\\Shell\\open\\command*"
  AND (Registry.registry_value_name = "(Default)" OR Registry.registry_value_name

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
