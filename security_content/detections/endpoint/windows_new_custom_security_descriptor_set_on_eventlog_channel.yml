description: The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to the EventLog
  security descriptor registry value for defense evasion. It leverages data from the
  Endpoint.Registry data model, focusing on changes to the "CustomSD" value within
  the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog\<Channel>\CustomSD"
  path. This activity is significant as changes to the access permissions of the event
  log could blind security products and help attackers evade defenses. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow attackers to block users and security products from
  viewing, ingesting and interacting event logs.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 13
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry WHERE Registry.registry_path= "*\\Services\\Eventlog\\*"
  AND Registry.registry_value_name=CustomSD by Registry.action Registry.dest Registry.process_guid

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of
  the official Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
known_false_positives: None identified, setting up the "CustomSD" value is considered
  a legacy option and shouldn't be a common activity.
