description: The following analytic detects changes in a service security descriptor
  where a new deny ace has been added. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, specifically searching for any process execution involving
  the "sc.exe" binary with the "sdset" flag targeting any service and adding a dedicated
  deny ace. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to escalate their
  privileges, blind defenses and more.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process name, and process original file name.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: None identified. Attempts to disable security-related services
  should be identified and understood.
