description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet
  with the `DS_Computer` class parameter via PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104).
  This detection leverages script block text to identify queries targeting domain
  computers using WMI. Monitoring this activity is crucial as adversaries and Red
  Teams may use it for Active Directory Discovery and situational awareness. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to map out domain computers, facilitating
  further attacks such as lateral movement or privilege escalation.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
