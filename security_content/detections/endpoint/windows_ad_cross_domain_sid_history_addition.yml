description: The following analytic detects changes to the sIDHistory attribute of
  user or computer objects across different domains. It leverages Windows Security
  Event Codes 4738 and 4742 to identify when the sIDHistory attribute is modified.
  This activity is significant because the sIDHistory attribute allows users to inherit
  permissions from other AD accounts, which can be exploited by adversaries for inter-domain
  privilege escalation and persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could enable
  attackers to gain unauthorized access to resources, maintain persistence, and escalate
  privileges across domain boundaries.
search: '`wineventlog_security` (EventCode=4742 OR EventCode=4738) NOT SidHistory
  IN ("%%1793", -) | rex field=SidHistory "(^%{|^)(?P<SidHistoryMatch>.*)(\-|\\\)"
  | rex field=TargetSid "^(?P<TargetSidmatch>.*)(\-|\\\)" | where SidHistoryMatch!=TargetSidmatch
  AND SidHistoryMatch!=TargetDomainName | rename TargetSid as userSid | table _time
  action status host user userSid SidHistory Logon_ID src_user dest | `windows_ad_cross_domain_sid_history_addition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  eventcodes `4738` and `4742`. The Advanced Security Audit policy settings `Audit
  User Account Management` and  `Audit Computer Account Management` within `Account
  Management` all need to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Domain mergers and migrations may generate large volumes of
  false positives for this analytic.
