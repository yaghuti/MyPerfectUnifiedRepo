description: This detection identifies instances where rundll32.exe is used to load a DLL from a temporary directory, such as C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\Temp\ or C:\Windows\Temp\. While rundll32.exe is a legitimate Windows utility used to execute functions exported from DLLs, its use to load libraries from temporary locations is highly suspicious. These directories are commonly used by malware and red team tools to stage payloads or execute code in-memory without writing it to more persistent locations. This behavior often indicates defense evasion, initial access, or privilege escalation, especially when the DLL is unsigned, recently written, or executed shortly after download. In normal user workflows, DLLs are not typically loaded from Temp paths, making this a high-fidelity indicator of potentially malicious activity. Monitoring this pattern is essential for detecting threats that attempt to blend in with native system processes while bypassing traditional application controls.

how_to_implement:
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
