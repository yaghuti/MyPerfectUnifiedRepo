description:
  The following analytic detects the use of PowerShell commands to copy
  the SAM, SYSTEM, or SECURITY hives, which are critical for credential theft. It
  leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to capture and analyze
  the full command executed. This activity is significant as it indicates an attempt
  to exfiltrate sensitive registry hives for offline password cracking. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to credentials, enabling further
  compromise of the system and potential lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText IN ("*copy*","*[System.IO.File]::Copy*")
  AND ScriptBlockText IN ("*System32\\config\\SAM*", "*System32\\config\\SYSTEM*","*System32\\config\\SECURITY*")
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID
  ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `detect_copy_of_shadowcopy_with_script_block_logging_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  Limited false positives as the scope is limited to SAM, SYSTEM
  and SECURITY hives.
