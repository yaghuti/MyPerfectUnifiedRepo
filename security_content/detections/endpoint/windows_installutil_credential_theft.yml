description: The following analytic detects instances where the Windows InstallUtil.exe
  binary loads `vaultcli.dll` and `Samlib.dll`. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode
  7 to identify these specific DLL loads. This activity is significant because it
  can indicate an attempt to execute code that bypasses application control and captures
  credentials using tools like Mimikatz. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could
  allow an attacker to steal credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access
  and further compromise of the system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 process_name=installutil.exe loaded_file_path IN ("*\\samlib.dll",
  "*\\vaultcli.dll") | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by Image ImageLoaded dest loaded_file loaded_file_path original_file_name
  process_exec process_guid process_hash process_id process_name process_path service_dll_signature_exists
  service_dll_signature_verified signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_installutil_credential_theft_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and module loads from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Typically, this will not trigger because, by its very nature,
  InstallUtil does not require credentials. Filter as needed.
