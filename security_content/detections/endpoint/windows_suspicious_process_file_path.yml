description: The following analytic identifies processes running from file paths
  not typically associated with legitimate software. It leverages data from 
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific process 
  paths within the Endpoint data model. This activity is significant because 
  adversaries often use unconventional file paths to execute malicious code 
  without requiring administrative privileges. If confirmed malicious, this 
  behavior could indicate an attempt to bypass security controls, leading to 
  unauthorized software execution, potential system compromise, and further 
  malicious activities within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint 
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide 
  security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To
  implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, 
  process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete 
  command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate 
  Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must 
  also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the 
  Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed 
  up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow execution of specific binaries 
  in non-standard paths. Filter as needed.
