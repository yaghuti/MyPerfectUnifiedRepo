description: The following analytic detects the creation of new user accounts on Linux
  systems using commands like "useradd" or "adduser." It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant as adversaries often create new user accounts
  to establish persistence on compromised hosts. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow attackers to maintain access, escalate privileges, and further compromise
  the system, posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` proctitle IN ("*useradd*", "*adduser*")
  | rename host as dest 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by proctitle dest  
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`linux_auditd_add_user_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
