description: The following analytic identifies the creation or deletion of 
  scheduled tasks using the schtasks.exe utility with the -create or -delete 
  flags. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, 
  focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is 
  significant as it can indicate unauthorized system manipulation or malicious 
  intent, often associated with threat actors like Dragonfly and incidents such 
  as the SUNBURST attack. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow 
  attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, or persist within the 
  environment, posing a significant security risk.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint 
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide 
  security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To
  implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, 
  process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete 
  command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate 
  Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must 
  also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the 
  Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed 
  up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: While it is possible for legitimate scripts or 
  administrators to trigger this behavior, filtering can be applied based on the
  parent process and application to reduce false positives. Analysts should 
  reference the provided references to understand the context and threat 
  landscape associated with this activity.
