description: The following analytic detects when a device is the target of numerous
  NTLM authentications using a null domain. This activity generally results when an
  attacker attempts to brute force, password spray, or otherwise authenticate to a
  domain joined Windows device from a non-domain device. This activity may also generate
  a large number of EventID 4776 events in tandem, however these events will not indicate
  the attacker or target device.

how_to_implement: The following analytic detects when an unusual number of NTLM authentications
  is attempted against the same destination. This activity generally results when
  an attacker attempts to brute force, password spray, or otherwise authenticate to
  a domain joined Windows device using an NTLM based process/attack. This same activity
  may also generate a large number of EventID 4776 events as well.
known_false_positives: Vulnerability scanners, print servers, and applications that
  deal with non-domain joined authentications. Recommend adjusting the upperBound_unique
  eval for tailoring the correlation to your environment, running with a 24hr search
  window will smooth out some statistical noise.
