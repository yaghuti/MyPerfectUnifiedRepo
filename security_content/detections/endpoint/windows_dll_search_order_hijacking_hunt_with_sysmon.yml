description: The following analytic identifies potential DLL search order hijacking
  or DLL sideloading by detecting known Windows libraries loaded from non-standard
  directories. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to monitor DLL loads and cross-references
  them with a lookup of known hijackable libraries. This activity is significant as
  it may indicate an attempt to execute malicious code by exploiting DLL search order
  vulnerabilities. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to gain code
  execution, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 NOT (process_path IN ("*\\system32\\*", "*\\syswow64\\*","*\\winsxs\\*","*\\wbem\\*"))
  | lookup hijacklibs library AS loaded_file OUTPUT islibrary | search islibrary =
  True | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded
  dest loaded_file loaded_file_path original_file_name process_exec process_guid process_hash
  process_id process_name process_path service_dll_signature_exists service_dll_signature_verified
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_dll_search_order_hijacking_hunt_with_sysmon_filter`'
how_to_implement: The search is written against the latest Sysmon TA 4.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709.
  For this specific event ID 7, the sysmon TA will extract the ImageLoaded name to
  the loaded_file field which is used in the search to compare against the hijacklibs
  lookup.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on paths. Filter or add
  other paths to the exclusion as needed. Some applications may legitimately load
  libraries from non-standard paths.
