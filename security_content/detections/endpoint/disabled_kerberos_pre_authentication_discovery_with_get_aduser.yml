type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-ADUser` 
  PowerShell cmdlet with parameters indicating a search for domain accounts with
  Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled. It leverages PowerShell Script Block 
  Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this specific activity. This behavior is 
  significant because discovering accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication 
  disabled can allow adversaries to perform offline password cracking. If 
  confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access to user 
  accounts, potentially compromising sensitive information and escalating 
  privileges within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*Get-ADUser*" AND ScriptBlockText="*4194304*")
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID
  ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `disabled_kerberos_pre_authentication_discovery_with_get_aduser_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to 
  enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional 
  setup here

known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use search for accounts
  with Kerberos Pre Authentication disabled for legitimate purposes.
