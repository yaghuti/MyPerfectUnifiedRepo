type: TTP
status: production
description: The following analytic identifies instances where more than five unique
  Windows accounts are disabled within a 10-minute window, as indicated by Event Code
  4725 in the Windows Security Event Log. It leverages the wineventlog_security dataset,
  grouping data into 10-minute segments and tracking the count and distinct count
  of TargetUserName. This behavior is significant as it may indicate internal policy
  breaches or an external attacker's attempt to disrupt operations. If confirmed malicious,
  this activity could lead to widespread account lockouts, hindering user access and
  potentially disrupting business operations.
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4725 status=success | bucket span=10m _time
  | stats count dc(user) as unique_users values(user) as user values(dest) as dest
  by EventCode signature _time src_user SubjectDomainName TargetDomainName Logon_ID
  | where unique_users > 5 | `windows_multiple_accounts_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller events with the Windows TA. The Advanced Security Audit policy
  setting `Audit User Account Management` within `Account Management` needs to be
  enabled.
known_false_positives: Service accounts may be responsible for the creation, deletion
  or modification of accounts for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
