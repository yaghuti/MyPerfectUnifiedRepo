- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-DomainOU` cmdlet,
  a part of the PowerView toolkit used for Windows domain enumeration. It leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify this activity. Detecting
  `Get-DomainOU` usage is significant as adversaries may use it to gather information
  about organizational units within Active Directory, which can facilitate lateral
  movement or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  attackers to map the domain structure, aiding in further exploitation and persistence
  within the network.

how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerSploit tools for legitimate
  reasons, filter as needed.
