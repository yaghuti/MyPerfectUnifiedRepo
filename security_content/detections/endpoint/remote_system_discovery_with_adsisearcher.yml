description:
  The following analytic detects the use of the `[Adsisearcher]` type accelerator
  in PowerShell scripts to query Active Directory for domain computers. It leverages
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify specific script blocks
  containing `adsisearcher` and `objectcategory=computer` with methods like `findAll()`
  or `findOne()`. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt by adversaries
  or Red Teams to perform Active Directory discovery and gain situational awareness.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to further reconnaissance and potential
  lateral movement within the network.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*adsisearcher*" AND ScriptBlockText
  = "*objectcategory=computer*" AND ScriptBlockText IN ("*findAll()*","*findOne()*")
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID
  ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `remote_system_discovery_with_adsisearcher_filter`'
how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use Adsisearcher for troubleshooting.
