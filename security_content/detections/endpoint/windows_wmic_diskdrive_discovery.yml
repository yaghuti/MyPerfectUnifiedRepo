description: The following analytic detects the use of Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) for disk drive discovery activities on a Windows system. This process involves monitoring commands such as “wmic diskdrive” which are often used by administrators for inventory and diagnostics but can also be leveraged by attackers to enumerate hardware details for malicious purposes. Detecting these commands is essential for identifying potentially unauthorized asset reconnaissance or pre-attack mapping behaviors. By capturing and analyzing WMIC disk drive queries, security teams can gain visibility into suspicious activities, enabling them to respond promptly and strengthen the organization’s security posture against insider threats or lateral movement attempts.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators may execute this command for testing or auditing.
