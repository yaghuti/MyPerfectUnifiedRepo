description:
  The following analytic detects the use of Windows InstallUtil.exe with
  an HTTP or HTTPS URL in the command line. This is identified through Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions containing URLs.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to download and execute
  malicious code, potentially bypassing application control mechanisms. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation,
  or persistent access within the environment. Analysts should review the parent process,
  network connections, file modifications, and related processes for further investigation.

how_to_implement:
  The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives:
  Limited false positives should be present as InstallUtil is
  not typically used to download remote files. Filter as needed based on Developers
  requirements.
