description: The following analytic identifies processes loading Mozilla 
  NSS-Mozglue libraries such as mozglue.dll and nss3.dll. It leverages Sysmon 
  Event logs, specifically monitoring EventCode 7, which tracks image loaded 
  events. This activity is significant because it can indicate unauthorized 
  access or manipulation of these libraries, which are commonly used by Mozilla 
  applications like Firefox and Thunderbird. If confirmed malicious, this could 
  lead to data exfiltration, credential theft, or further compromise of the 
  system.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7

  IN("*:\\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe", "*:\\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your 
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of 
  the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Legitimate windows application that are not on the list 
  loading this dll. Filter as needed.
