description: The following analytic identifies potential DNS exfiltration using the
  nslookup application. It detects specific command-line parameters such as query
  type (TXT, A, AAAA) and retry options, which are commonly used by attackers to exfiltrate
  data. The detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing
  on process execution logs. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt
  to communicate with a Command and Control (C2) server or exfiltrate sensitive data.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access
  to critical information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
