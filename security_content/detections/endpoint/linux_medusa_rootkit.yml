description: This detection identifies file creation events associated with the installation of the Medusa 
  rootkit, a userland LD_PRELOAD-based rootkit known for deploying shared objects, loader binaries, and
  configuration files into specific system directories. These files typically facilitate process hiding, 
  credential theft, and backdoor access. Monitoring for such file creation patterns enables early 
  detection of rootkit deployment before full compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Little to no false positives in most environments. Tune as needed.
