description: The following analytic detects the loading of drivers from 
  suspicious paths, which is a technique often used by malicious software such 
  as coin miners (e.g., xmrig). It leverages Sysmon EventCode 6 to identify 
  drivers loaded from non-standard directories. This activity is significant 
  because legitimate drivers typically reside in specific system directories, 
  and deviations may indicate malicious activity. If confirmed malicious, this 
  could allow an attacker to execute code at the kernel level, potentially 
  leading to privilege escalation, persistence, or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 6
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=6 ImageLoaded = "*.sys" NOT (ImageLoaded IN("*\\WINDOWS\\inf","*\\WINDOWS\\System32\\drivers\\*",
  "*\\WINDOWS\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository\\*","*:\Windows\\WinSxS\\*","*\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows
  Defender\\Definition Updates\\*")) |  stats  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime count by ImageLoaded dest dvc process_hash process_path signature signature_id
  user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_suspicious_driver_loaded_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting logs with the driver loaded and Signature from your endpoints. If 
  you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives will be present. Some 
  applications do load drivers
