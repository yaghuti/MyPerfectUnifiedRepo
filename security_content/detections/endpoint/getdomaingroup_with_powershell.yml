description: The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` with
  command-line arguments that query for domain groups using `Get-DomainGroup`. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process names and command-line executions mapped to the `Processes` node of the
  `Endpoint` data model. Monitoring this activity is crucial as `Get-DomainGroup`
  is part of PowerView, a tool often used by adversaries for domain enumeration and
  situational awareness. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers
  to gain insights into domain group structures, aiding in further exploitation and
  privilege escalation.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
