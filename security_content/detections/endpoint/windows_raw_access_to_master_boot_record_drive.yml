description: The following analytic detects suspicious raw access reads to the 
  drive containing the Master Boot Record (MBR). It leverages Sysmon EventCode 9
  to identify processes attempting to read or write to the MBR sector, excluding
  legitimate system processes. This activity is significant because adversaries 
  often target the MBR to wipe, encrypt, or overwrite it as part of their impact
  payload. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to system instability, data 
  loss, or a complete system compromise, severely impacting the organization's 
  operations.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 9
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=9 Device = \\Device\\Harddisk0\\DR0 NOT (Image IN("*\\Windows\\System32\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by dest dvc process_exec process_guid process_id process_name process_path
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product Device Image | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_raw_access_to_master_boot_record_drive_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting logs with the raw access read event (like sysmon eventcode 9), 
  process name and process guid from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, 
  you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: There are som minimal number of normal applications from 
  system32 folder like svchost.exe accessing the MBR. In this case we used 
  'system32' and 'syswow64' path as a filter for this detection.
