description: The following analytic detects the insertion of a Linux kernel module
  using the insmod utility. It leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on process
  execution logs that include process names and command-line details. This activity
  is significant as it may indicate the installation of a rootkit or malicious kernel
  module, potentially allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges and bypass
  security detections. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code
  execution, persistent access, and severe compromise of the affected system.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm=insmod 
  | rename host as dest 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime 
  by comm exe  syscall uid ppid pid success dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_auditd_insert_kernel_module_using_insmod_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures
  command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should
  be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
