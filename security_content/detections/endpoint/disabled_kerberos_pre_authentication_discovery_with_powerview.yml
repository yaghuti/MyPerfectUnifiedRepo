description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 
  `Get-DomainUser` commandlet with the `-PreauthNotRequired` parameter using 
  PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This command is part of 
  PowerView, a tool used for enumerating Windows Active Directory networks. 
  Identifying domain accounts with Kerberos Pre-Authentication disabled is 
  significant because adversaries can leverage this information to attempt 
  offline password cracking. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to
  unauthorized access to domain accounts, potentially compromising sensitive 
  information and escalating privileges within the network.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*Get-DomainUser*" AND ScriptBlockText="*PreauthNotRequired*")
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID
  ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `disabled_kerberos_pre_authentication_discovery_with_powerview_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to 
  enable PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional 
  setup here
