description: The following analytic detects suspicious database file and directory
  discovery activities, which may signal an attacker attempt to locate and assess
  critical database assets on a compromised system. This behavior is often a precursor
  to data theft, unauthorized access, or privilege escalation, as attackers seek to
  identify valuable information stored in databases. By monitoring for unusual or
  unauthorized attempts to locate database files and directories, this analytic aids
  in early detection of potential reconnaissance or data breach efforts, enabling
  security teams to respond swiftly and mitigate the risk of further compromise.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` execve_command IN ("*find*", "*grep*") AND execve_command IN("*.db*", "*.sql*", "*.sqlite*", "*.mdb*", "*.accdb*", "*.mdf*", "*.ndf*", "*.ldf*", "*.frm*", "*.myd*", "*.myi*", "*.dbf*", "*.db2*", "*.dbc*", "*.fpt*", "*.ora*") 
  | rename host as dest 
  | rename comm as process_name 
  | rename exe as process 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by argc execve_command dest

  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_auditd_database_file_and_directory_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
