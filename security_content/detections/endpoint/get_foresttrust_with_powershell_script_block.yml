description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the Get-ForestTrust command
  from PowerSploit using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This method
  captures the full command sent to PowerShell, providing detailed visibility into
  potentially suspicious activities. Monitoring this behavior is crucial as it can
  indicate an attempt to gather domain trust information, which is often a precursor
  to lateral movement or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow an attacker to map trust relationships within the domain, facilitating
  further exploitation and access to sensitive resources.
data_source:
  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search:
  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*get-foresttrust*" | fillnull
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest signature signature_id
  user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
