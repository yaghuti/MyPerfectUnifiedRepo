description: The following analytic detects suspicious file downloads by the 
  Telegram application on a Windows system. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 15 to 
  identify instances where Telegram.exe creates files with a Zone.Identifier, 
  indicating a download. This activity is significant as it may indicate an 
  adversary using Telegram to download malicious tools, such as network 
  scanners, for further exploitation. If confirmed malicious, this behavior 
  could lead to network mapping, lateral movement, and potential compromise of 
  additional systems within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 15
search: '`sysmon` EventCode= 15 process_name = "telegram.exe" TargetFilename = "*:Zone.Identifier"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest dvc file_hash
  file_name file_path process_exec process_guid process_id process_name process_path
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product Contents Image | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `download_files_using_telegram_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting logs with the process name and TargetFilename from your endpoints or
  Events that monitor filestream events which is happened when process download 
  something. (EventCode 15) If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least 
  version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: normal download of file in telegram app. (if it was a 
  common app in network)
