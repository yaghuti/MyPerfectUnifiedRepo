name: Windows Credentials in Registry Reg Query

description: The following analytic identifies processes querying the registry for
  potential passwords or credentials. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that access specific
  registry paths known to store sensitive information. This activity is significant
  as it may indicate credential theft attempts, often used by adversaries or post-exploitation
  tools like winPEAS. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to privilege
  escalation, persistence, or lateral movement within the network, posing a severe
  security risk.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
