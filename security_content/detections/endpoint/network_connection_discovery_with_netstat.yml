description: The following analytic detects the execution of `netstat.exe` with command-line
  arguments to list network connections on a system. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, command-line executions,
  and parent processes. This activity is significant as both Red Teams and adversaries
  use `netstat.exe` for situational awareness and Active Directory discovery. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to map network connections, identify
  critical systems, and plan further lateral movement or data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
