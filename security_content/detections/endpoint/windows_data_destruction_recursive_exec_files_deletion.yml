description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process that is recursively
  deleting executable files on a compromised host. It leverages Sysmon Event Codes
  23 and 26 to detect this activity by monitoring for a high volume of deletions or
  overwrites of files with extensions like .exe, .sys, and .dll. This behavior is
  significant as it is commonly associated with destructive malware such as CaddyWiper,
  DoubleZero, and SwiftSlicer, which aim to make file recovery impossible. If confirmed
  malicious, this activity could lead to significant data loss and system instability,
  severely impacting business operations.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 23
- Sysmon EventID 26
search: '`sysmon` EventCode IN ("23","26") TargetFilename IN ("*.exe", "*.sys", "*.dll")
  | bin _time span=2m | stats count min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime
  values(file_path) as file_path values(file_hash) as file_hash values(file_name)

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_data_destruction_recursive_exec_files_deletion_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to ingest logs that
  include the process name, TargetFilename, and ProcessID executions from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, ensure you have at least version 2.0 of the Sysmon TA installed.
known_false_positives: The uninstallation of a large software application or the use
  of cleanmgr.exe may trigger this detection. A filter is necessary to reduce false
  positives.
