type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the chmod utility to
  set the SUID or SGID bit on files, which can allow users to temporarily gain root
  or group-level access. This detection leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing
  on process names and command-line arguments related to chmod. This activity is significant
  as it can indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain persistence on
  a system. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain elevated access, potentially
  compromising sensitive data or critical system functions.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd`  proctitle IN ("*chmod *")  AND proctitle IN ("* u+s *", "* g+s *", "* 4777 *", "* 4577 *")
  | rename host as dest  
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by  proctitle  dest 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `linux_auditd_setuid_using_chmod_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
