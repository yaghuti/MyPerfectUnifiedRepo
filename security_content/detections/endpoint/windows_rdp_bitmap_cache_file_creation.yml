description: This detection identifies the creation of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) bitmap cache files on a Windows system, typically located in the userâ€™s profile under the Terminal Server Client cache directory. These files (*.bmc, cache*.bin) are generated when a user initiates an RDP session using the built-in mstsc.exe client. Their presence can indicate interactive remote access activity and may be useful in detecting lateral movement or unauthorized RDP usage. Monitoring this behavior is especially important, as attackers may attempt to delete or suppress these artifacts to evade forensic analysis.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest logs that
  include the process name, TargetFilename, and ProcessID executions from your endpoints.
  If you are utilizing Sysmon, ensure you have at least version 2.0 of the Sysmon
  TA installed.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present, filter as needed or restrict
  to critical assets on the perimeter.
