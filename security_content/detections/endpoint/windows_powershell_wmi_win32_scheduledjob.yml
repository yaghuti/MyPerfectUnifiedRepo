  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description:
  The following analytic detects the use of the Win32_ScheduledJob WMI
  class via PowerShell script block logging. This class, which manages scheduled tasks,
  is disabled by default due to security concerns and must be explicitly enabled through
  registry modifications. The detection leverages PowerShell event code 4104 and script
  block text analysis. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it may indicate malicious
  intent, especially if the class was enabled by an attacker. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to persist in the environment by creating scheduled tasks.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  False positives may be present based on legacy applications
  or utilities. Win32_ScheduledJob uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol to
  create scheduled tasks on remote computers. It uses the DCOM (Distributed Component
  Object Model) infrastructure to establish a connection with the remote computer
  and invoke the necessary methods. The RPC service needs to be running on both the
  local and remote computers for the communication to take place.
