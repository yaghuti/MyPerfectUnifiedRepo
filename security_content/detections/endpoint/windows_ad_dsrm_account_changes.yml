description: The following analytic identifies changes to the Directory Services Restore
  Mode (DSRM) account behavior via registry modifications. It detects alterations
  in the registry path "*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\DSRMAdminLogonBehavior"
  with specific values indicating potential misuse. This activity is significant because
  the DSRM account, if misconfigured, can be exploited to persist within a domain,
  similar to a local administrator account. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could
  gain persistent administrative access to a Domain Controller, leading to potential
  domain-wide compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
