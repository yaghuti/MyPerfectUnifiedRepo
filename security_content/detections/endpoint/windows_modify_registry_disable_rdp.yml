description: This analytic is developed to detect suspicious registry 
  modifications that disable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by altering the 
  "fDenyTSConnections" key. Changing this key's value to 1 prevents remote 
  connections, which can disrupt remote management and access. Such 
  modifications could indicate an attempt to hinder remote administration or 
  isolate the system from remote intervention, potentially signifying malicious 
  activity.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting
  information on process that include the name of the process responsible for 
  the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the 
  `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is 
  installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: administrators may enable or disable this feature that 
  may cause some false positive.
