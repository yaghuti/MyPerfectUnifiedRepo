description: The following analytic identifies a high frequency of process 
  termination events on a computer within a short period. It leverages Sysmon 
  EventCode 5 logs to detect instances where 15 or more processes are terminated
  within a 3-second window. This behavior is significant as it is commonly 
  associated with ransomware attempting to avoid exceptions during file 
  encryption. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an active 
  ransomware attack, potentially leading to widespread file encryption and 
  significant data loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 5
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=5 | bin _time span=3s | stats values(process) as process
  values(process_exec) as process_exec values(process_guid) as process_guid values(process_id)
  as process_id values(process_name) as process_name values(process_path) as process_path
  values(user_id) as user_id min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count
  by _time dest EventCode ProcessID signature signature_id vendor_product | where
  count >= 15 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `high_process_termination_frequency_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting logs with the Image (process full path of terminated process) from 
  your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 
  of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: admin or user tool that can terminate multiple process.
