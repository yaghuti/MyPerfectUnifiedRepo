description: The following analytic detects suspicious raw access reads to the 
  device disk partition of a host machine. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 9 logs 
  to identify processes attempting to read or write to the boot sector, 
  excluding legitimate system processes. This activity is significant as it is 
  commonly associated with destructive actions by adversaries, such as wiping, 
  encrypting, or overwriting the boot sector, as seen in attacks involving 
  malware like HermeticWiper. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead 
  to severe impacts, including system inoperability, data loss, or compromised 
  boot integrity.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 9
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=9 Device = \\Device\\HarddiskVolume* NOT (Image IN("*\\Windows\\System32\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\*")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as
  lastTime by dest dvc process_exec process_guid process_id process_name process_path
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product Device Image | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_raw_access_to_disk_volume_partition_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting logs with the raw access read event (like sysmon eventcode 9), 
  process name and process guid from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, 
  you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: There are som minimal number of normal applications from 
  system32 folder like svchost.exe accessing the MBR. In this case we used 
  'system32' and 'syswow64' path as a filter for this detection.
