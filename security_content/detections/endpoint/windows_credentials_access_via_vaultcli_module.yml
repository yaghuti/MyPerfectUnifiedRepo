description: The following analytic detects potentially abnormal interactions with
  VaultCLI.dll, particularly those initiated by processes located in publicly writable
  Windows folder paths. The VaultCLI.dll module allows processes to extract credentials
  from the Windows Credential Vault. It was seen being abused by information stealers
  such as Meduza. The analytic monitors suspicious API calls, unauthorized credential
  access patterns, and anomalous process behaviors indicative of malicious activity.
  By leveraging a combination of signature-based detection and behavioral analysis,
  it effectively flags attempts to misuse the vault for credential theft, enabling
  swift response to protect sensitive user data and ensure system security.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and imageloaded executions from your endpoints. If you
  are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Third party software might leverage this DLL in order to make
  use of the Credential Manager feature via the provided exports. Typically the vaultcli.dll
  module is loaded by the vaultcmd.exe Windows Utility to interact with the Windows
  Credential Manager for secure storage and retrieval of credentials.
