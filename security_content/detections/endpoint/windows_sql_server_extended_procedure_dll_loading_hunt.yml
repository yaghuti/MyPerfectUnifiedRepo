description: This analytic detects when SQL Server loads DLLs to execute extended stored procedures. This is particularly important for security monitoring as it indicates the first-time use or version changes of potentially dangerous procedures like xp_cmdshell, sp_OACreate, and others. While this is a legitimate operation, adversaries may abuse these procedures for execution, discovery, or privilege escalation.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this detection, ensure Windows Event Log collection is enabled and collecting from the Application channel. SQL Server must be configured to log to the Windows Application log (enabled by default). The Splunk Windows TA is also required.
known_false_positives: Legitimate administrative activity and normal database operations may trigger this detection. Common false positives include initial database startup and configuration, patch deployment and version updates, regular administrative tasks using extended stored procedures, and application servers that legitimately use OLE automation.
