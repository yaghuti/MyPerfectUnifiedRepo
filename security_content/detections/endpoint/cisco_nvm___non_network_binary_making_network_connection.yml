description: |
  This analytic detects network connections initiated by binaries that are not typically associated with network communication,
  such as 'notepad.exe', 'calc.exe' or 'write.exe'.
  It leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module logs to correlate network flow activity with process context, including command-line arguments, process path, and parent process information.
  These applications are normally used for locally and do not require outbound network access. When they do initiate such connections, it may indicate process hollowing, code injection, or proxy execution, where adversaries abuse a trusted process to mask malicious activity.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  Rare cases may exist where these binaries are used by plugins or third-party extensions to initiate outbound communication.
  However, such behavior is extremely uncommon and should be investigated for potential injection or abuse.
