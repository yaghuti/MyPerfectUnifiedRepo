description: The following analytic detects the abuse of SqlWriter and SQLDumper executables
  to sideload the vcruntime140.dll library. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 logs,
  focusing on instances where SQLDumper.exe or SQLWriter.exe load vcruntime140.dll,
  excluding legitimate loads from the System32 directory. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential DLL sideloading, a technique used by adversaries to execute
  malicious code within trusted processes. If confirmed malicious, this could allow
  attackers to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence, and evade detection by
  blending with legitimate processes.

  ImageLoaded="*\\vcruntime140.dll" NOT ImageLoaded="C:\\Windows\\System32\\*" | fillnull
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded

how_to_implement: The analytic is designed to be run against Sysmon event logs collected
  from endpoints. The analytic requires the Sysmon event logs to be ingested into
  Splunk. The analytic searches for EventCode 7 where the Image is either SQLDumper.exe
  or SQLWriter.exe and the ImageLoaded is vcruntime140.dll. The search also filters
  out the legitimate loading of vcruntime140.dll from the System32 directory to reduce
  false positives. The analytic can be modified to include additional known good paths
  for vcruntime140.dll to further reduce false positives.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate processes are loading
  vcruntime140.dll from non-standard directories. It is recommended to investigate
  the context of the process loading vcruntime140.dll to determine if it is malicious
  or not. Modify the search to include additional known good paths for vcruntime140.dll
  to reduce false positives.
