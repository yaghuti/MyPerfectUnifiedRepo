  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description:
  The following analytic detects potential malicious activities involving
  PowerShell's task scheduling cmdlets. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging
  (EventCode 4104) to identify unusual or suspicious use of cmdlets like 'New-ScheduledTask'
  and 'Set-ScheduledTask'. This activity is significant as attackers often use these
  cmdlets for persistence and remote execution of malicious code. If confirmed malicious,
  this could allow attackers to maintain access, deliver additional payloads, or execute
  ransomware, leading to data theft or other severe impacts. Immediate investigation
  and mitigation are crucial to prevent further compromise.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://help.splunk.com/en/security-offerings/splunk-user-behavior-analytics/get-data-in/5.4.1/add-other-data-to-splunk-uba/configure-powershell-logging-to-see-powershell-anomalies-in-splunk-uba.
known_false_positives:
  Benign administrative tasks can also trigger alerts, necessitating
  a firm understanding of the typical system behavior and precise tuning of the analytic
  to reduce false positives.
