description:
  The following analytic detects the execution of the `Get-AdGroup` PowerShell
  cmdlet using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This cmdlet is used
  to enumerate all domain groups, which adversaries may exploit for situational awareness
  and Active Directory discovery. Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can indicate
  reconnaissance efforts within the network. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could lead to further exploitation, such as privilege escalation or lateral movement,
  by providing attackers with detailed information about the domain's group structure.

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here

known_false_positives:
  Administrators or power users may use this PowerShell commandlet
  for troubleshooting.
