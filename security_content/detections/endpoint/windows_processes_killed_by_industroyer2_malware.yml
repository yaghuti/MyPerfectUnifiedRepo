name: Windows Processes Killed By Industroyer2 Malware

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the termination of specific processes
  by the Industroyer2 malware. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 5 to identify when processes
  like "PServiceControl.exe" and "PService_PPD.exe" are killed. This activity is significant
  as it targets processes related to energy facility networks, indicating a potential
  attack on critical infrastructure. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to disruption
  of essential services, loss of control over energy systems, and significant operational
  impact. Immediate investigation is required to determine the cause and mitigate
  any potential threats.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 5
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=5 process_name IN ("PServiceControl.exe", "PService_PPD.exe")
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest process process_exec
  process_guid process_id process_name process_path signature signature_id user_id
  vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_processes_killed_by_industroyer2_malware_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4698 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: False positives are possible if legitimate applications are
  allowed to terminate this process during testing or updates. Filter as needed based
  on paths that are used legitimately.
