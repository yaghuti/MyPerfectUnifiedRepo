description: |
  This analytic detects suspicious use of `rundll32.exe` in combination with `mshtml.dll` and the export `RunHTMLApplication`.
  This behavior is often observed in malware to execute JavaScript or VBScript in memory, enabling payload staging or
  bypassing script execution policies and bypassing the usage of the "mshta.exe" binary.
  The detection leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module telemetry which offers network flow activity
  along with process information such as command-line arguments
  If confirmed malicious, this activity may indicate initial access or payload download.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  `rundll32.exe` using `mshtml.dll` is rare in legitimate environments. However, edge cases might exist. Tuning may be needed in environments with custom automation scripts.
