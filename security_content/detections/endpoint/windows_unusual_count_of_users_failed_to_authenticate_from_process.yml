data_source:
- Windows Event Log Security 4625
description: The following analytic identifies a source process failing to authenticate
  multiple users, potentially indicating a Password Spraying attack. It leverages
  Windows Event 4625, which logs failed logon attempts, and uses statistical analysis
  to detect anomalies. This activity is significant as it may represent an adversary
  attempting to gain initial access or elevate privileges within an Active Directory
  environment. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could compromise multiple accounts,
  leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within
  the network.
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Event Logs from domain controllers aas well as member servers and workstations.
  The Advanced Security Audit policy setting `Audit Logon` within `Logon/Logoff` needs
  to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A process failing to authenticate with multiple users is not
  a common behavior for legitimate user sessions. Possible false positive scenarios
  include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
