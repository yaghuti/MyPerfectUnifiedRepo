description: The following analytic detects suspicious PowerShell script execution
  via EventCode 4104, specifically targeting checks for installed anti-virus products
  using WMI or PowerShell commands. This detection leverages PowerShell Script Block
  Logging to identify scripts containing keywords like "SELECT," "WMIC," "AntiVirusProduct,"
  or "AntiSpywareProduct." This activity is significant as it is commonly used by
  malware and APT actors to map running security applications or services, potentially
  aiding in evasion techniques. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers
  to disable or bypass security measures, leading to further compromise of the endpoint.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 (ScriptBlockText = "*SELECT*" OR ScriptBlockText
  = "*WMIC*") AND (ScriptBlockText = "*AntiVirusProduct*" OR ScriptBlockText = "*AntiSpywareProduct*")
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product EventID Guid Opcode Name Path ProcessID
  ScriptBlockId ScriptBlockText | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `recon_avproduct_through_pwh_or_wmi_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
