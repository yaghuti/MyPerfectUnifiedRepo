description: The following analytic identifies an excessive number of distinct processes
  executing from the Windows\Temp directory. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process paths and counts within a 20-minute
  window. This behavior is significant as it often indicates the presence of post-exploit
  frameworks like Koadic and Meterpreter, which use this technique to execute malicious
  actions. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute
  arbitrary code, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence within the environment,
  posing a severe threat to system integrity and security.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Many benign applications will create processes from executables
  in Windows\Temp, although unlikely to exceed the given threshold.  Filter as needed.
