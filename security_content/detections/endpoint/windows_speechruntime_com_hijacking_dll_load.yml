description: SpeechRuntime is vulnerable to an attack that allows a user to run code on another user's 
  session remotely and stealthily by exploiting a Windows COM class. When this class 
  is invoked, it launches SpeechRuntime.exe in the context of the currently logged-on user. Because this 
  COM class is susceptible to COM Hijacking, the attacker can alter the registry remotely to point to a 
  malicious DLL. By dropping that DLL on the target system (e.g., via SMB) and triggering the COM object, 
  the attacker causes the malicious DLL to load into SpeechRuntime.exe and executing under the user's context. This
  detection identifies suspicious DLL loads by SpeechRuntime.exe from outside the expected locations.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 Image="*SpeechRuntime.exe" | eval image_loaded_lower = lower(ImageLoaded) 
  | search NOT image_loaded_lower="*system32*" | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded dest loaded_file loaded_file_path original_file_name 
  parent_process_name parent_process_guid
  process_exec process_guid process_hash process_id process_name process_path service_dll_signature_exists
  service_dll_signature_verified signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_speechruntime_com_hijacking_dll_load_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and ImageLoaded (Like sysmon EventCode 7) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Also be sure to include those monitored dll to your own sysmon config.
known_false_positives: This process should normally never be loading dlls from outside the Windows system directory.
