name: Cisco NVM - Curl Execution With Insecure Flags
id: cc695238-3117-4e60-aa83-4beac2a42c69

author: Nasreddine Bencherchali, Splunk
status: production
type: Anomaly
description: |
  This analytic detects the use of `curl.exe` with insecure flags such as `-k`, `--insecure`, `--proxy-insecure`, or `--doh-insecure`
  which disable TLS certificate validation.
  It leverages Cisco Network Visibility Module (NVM) flow data and process arguments
  to identify outbound connections initiated by curl where TLS checks were explicitly disabled.
  This behavior may indicate an attempt to bypass certificate validation to connect to potentially untrusted or malicious endpoints,
  a common tactic in red team operations, malware staging, or data exfiltration over HTTPS.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Network Visibility Module logs, which includes the flow data sourcetype.
  This search uses an input macro named `cisco_network_visibility_module_flowdata`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Network Visibility Module logs.
  Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment.
  The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Endpoint Security Analytics (CESA) (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4221).
known_false_positives: |
  Usage of these flags to reach public IPs or uncommon destinations should be reviewed.
  Tuning may be required for domains with known certificate issues.
