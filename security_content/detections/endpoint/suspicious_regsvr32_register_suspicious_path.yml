description: The following analytic detects the use of Regsvr32.exe to register DLLs
  from suspicious paths such as AppData, ProgramData, or Windows Temp directories.
  It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on
  process execution logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant
  because Regsvr32.exe can be abused to proxy execution of malicious code, bypassing
  traditional security controls. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration,
  or further lateral movement within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives with the query restricted to specified
  paths. Add more world writeable paths as tuning continues.
