description: This detection monitors the creation or modification of the Default.rdp file, typically found in the user's Documents folder. This file is automatically generated or updated by the Remote Desktop Connection client (mstsc.exe) when a user initiates an RDP session. It stores connection settings such as the last-used hostname, screen size, and other preferences. The presence or update of this file strongly suggests that an RDP session has been launched from the system. Since this file is commonly overlooked, it can serve as a valuable artifact in identifying remote access activity, including potential lateral movement or attacker-controlled sessions.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present, filter as needed or restrict
  to critical assets on the perimeter.
