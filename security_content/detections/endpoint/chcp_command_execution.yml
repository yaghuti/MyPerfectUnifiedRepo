description: The following analytic detects the execution of the chcp.com utility,
  which is used to change the active code page of the console. This detection leverages
  data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation
  events. This activity is significant because it can indicate the presence of malware,
  such as IcedID, which uses this technique to determine the locale region, language,
  or country of the compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to further
  system compromise and data exfiltration.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
