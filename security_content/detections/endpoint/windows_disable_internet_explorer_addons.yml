description: |
  The following analytic detects the execution of iexplore.exe (Internet Explorer) with the -extoff command-line flag, which disables all browser extensions. This flag is commonly abused by adversaries to launch a clean browser session that bypasses security controls such as antivirus browser extensions, toolbars, or group policy-enforced add-ons.
  Malicious documents or scripts may leverage iexplore.exe -extoff to open phishing pages, command-and-control interfaces, or download additional payloads in an environment free from security monitoring plugins. While this flag may be used legitimately by IT administrators for troubleshooting purposes, its use in modern enterprise environments is rare and should be considered suspiciousâ€”particularly when launched by Office applications, scripting engines (e.g., PowerShell, WScript), or scheduled tasks.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Administrators may enable or disable this feature that may
  cause some false positive.
