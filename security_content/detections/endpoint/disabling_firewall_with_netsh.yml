name: Disabling Firewall with Netsh

description: The following analytic identifies the disabling of the firewall using
  the netsh application. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  agents, focusing on command-line executions that include keywords like "firewall,"
  "off," or "disable." This activity is significant because disabling the firewall
  can expose the system to external threats, allowing malware to communicate with
  its command and control (C2) server. If confirmed malicious, this action could lead
  to unauthorized data exfiltration, further malware downloads, and broader network
  compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: admin may disable firewall during testing or fixing network
  problem.
