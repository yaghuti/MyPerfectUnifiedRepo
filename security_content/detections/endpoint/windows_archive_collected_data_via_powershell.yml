  - Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
description:
  The following analytic detects the use of PowerShell scripts to archive
  files into a temporary folder. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging, specifically
  monitoring for the `Compress-Archive` command targeting the `Temp` directory. This
  activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary's attempt to collect and
  compress data for exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead
  to unauthorized data access and exfiltration, posing a severe risk to sensitive
  information and overall network security.

  '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Compress-Archive*"  ScriptBlockText
  = "*\\Temp\\*" | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime

how_to_implement:
  To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
