description: The following analytic detects the deletion of shadow copies using the
  vssadmin.exe or wmic.exe utilities. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This
  activity is significant because deleting shadow copies is a common tactic used by
  attackers to prevent recovery and hide their tracks. If confirmed malicious, this
  action could hinder incident response efforts and allow attackers to maintain persistence
  and cover their activities, making it crucial for security teams to investigate
  promptly.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: vssadmin.exe and wmic.exe are standard applications shipped
  with modern versions of windows. They may be used by administrators to legitimately
  delete old backup copies, although this is typically rare.
