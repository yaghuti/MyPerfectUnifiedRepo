type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the suspicious sysmon service stop. This
  behavior is critical for a SOC to monitor because it may indicate attempts to gain
  unauthorized access or maintain control over a system. Such actions could be signs
  of malicious activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences, including
  a compromised system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a wider breach
  affecting the entire network. Detecting and responding to these signs early is essential
  to prevent potential security incidents.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Service Stop
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SERVICE_STOP unit IN ("sysmon") | rename host as dest
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by type pid comm
  exe unit dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `linux_auditd_sysmon_service_stop_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd
  data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line
  executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested
  and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833),
  which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step
  involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk
  Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources
  and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring
  and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
