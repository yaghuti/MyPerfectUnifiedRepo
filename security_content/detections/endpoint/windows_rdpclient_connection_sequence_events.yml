description: This analytic monitors Windows RDP client connection sequence 
  events (EventCode 1024) from the 
  Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operational log. These events 
  track when RDP ClientActiveX initiates connection attempts to remote servers. 
  The connection sequence is a critical phase of RDP where the client and server
  exchange settings and establish common parameters for the session. Monitoring 
  these events can help identify unusual RDP connection patterns, potential 
  lateral movement attempts, unauthorized remote access activity, and RDP 
  connection chains that may indicate compromised systems. NOTE the analytic was
  written for Multi-Line as XML was not properly parsed out.
data_source:
- Windows Event Log Microsoft Windows TerminalServices RDPClient 1024
search: '`wineventlog_rdp` EventCode=1024 | rename host as dest | stats count as "Event
  Count", min(_time) as firstTime, max(_time) as lastTime, values(Message) as messages
  by dest, source, LogName, EventCode, category | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_rdpclient_connection_sequence_events_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this detection, ensure Windows RDP 
  Client Operational logs are being collected and forwarded to Splunk. Enable 
  logging for "Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operational", via a 
  new inputs.conf input. See references for more details.
known_false_positives: Legitimate RDP connections from authorized administrators
  and users will generate these events. To reduce false positives, you should 
  baseline normal RDP connection patterns in your environment, whitelist 
  expected RDP connection chains between known administrative workstations and 
  servers, and track authorized remote support sessions.
