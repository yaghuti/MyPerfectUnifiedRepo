description: The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry
  that disable SmartScreen protection. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry
  data model, specifically monitoring changes to registry paths associated with SmartScreen
  settings. This activity is significant because SmartScreen provides an early warning
  system against phishing and malware. Disabling it can indicate malicious intent,
  often seen in Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to evade detection while downloading
  additional payloads. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to
  bypass security measures, increasing the risk of successful phishing attacks and
  malware infections.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 2.0 of the official
  Sysmon TA. https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709
