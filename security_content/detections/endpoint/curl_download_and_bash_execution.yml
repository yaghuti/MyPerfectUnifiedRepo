description: The following analytic detects the use of curl on Linux or MacOS systems
  to download a file from a remote source and pipe it directly to bash for execution.
  This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on process names, command-line arguments, and parent processes. This activity
  is significant as it is commonly associated with malicious actions such as coinminers
  and exploitation of vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-44228 in Log4j. If confirmed malicious,
  this behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, and
  further exploitation within the environment.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, however filtering may be
  required.
