description: The following analytic detects the creation of new user accounts on Linux
  systems using commands like "useradd" or "adduser." It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line
  executions. This activity is significant as adversaries often create new user accounts
  to establish persistence on compromised hosts. If confirmed malicious, this could
  allow attackers to maintain access, escalate privileges, and further compromise
  the system, posing a severe security risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon for Linux EventID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.process_name IN ("useradd", "adduser") OR Processes.process IN ("*useradd
  *", "*adduser *") by Processes.action Processes.dest Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_exec Processes.parent_process_guid
  Processes.parent_process_id Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process_path
  Processes.process Processes.process_exec Processes.process_guid Processes.process_hash
  Processes.process_id Processes.process_integrity_level Processes.process_name Processes.process_path
  Processes.user Processes.user_id Processes.vendor_product | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_add_user_account_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
