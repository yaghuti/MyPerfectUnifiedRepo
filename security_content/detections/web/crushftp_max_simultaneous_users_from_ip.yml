name: CrushFTP Max Simultaneous Users From IP

version: 2

author: Michael Haag, Splunk
status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies instances where CrushFTP has blocked access due to exceeding the maximum number of simultaneous connections from a single IP address. This activity may indicate brute force attempts, credential stuffing, or automated attacks against the CrushFTP server. This detection is particularly relevant following the discovery of CVE-2025-31161, an authentication bypass vulnerability in CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0.

search: '`crushftp` "*User access not allowed.  Max simultaneous users from your IP*" | rex field=_raw "SESSION\\|\\d+\\/\\d+\\/\\d+ \\d+:\\d+:\\d+\\.\\d+\\|\\[HTTP:[^:]+:(?<user>[^:]+):(?<src_ip>[0-9\\.]+)\\]" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(user) as user by src_ip | where count >= 3 | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `crushftp_max_simultaneous_users_from_ip_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, you need to ingest CrushFTP logs into your Splunk environment. Configure CrushFTP to forward logs to Splunk via a syslog forwarder or direct file monitoring. Ensure the sourcetype is correctly set for the CrushFTP logs. The detection requires the SESSION field and the "[HTTP:*:user:IP]" format in the logs. Adjust the threshold in the "where count >= 3" clause based on your environment's normal behavior.
known_false_positives: In environments where multiple users legitimately access CrushFTP from behind the same NAT or proxy, this may generate false positives. Tune the threshold based on your organization's usage patterns.
