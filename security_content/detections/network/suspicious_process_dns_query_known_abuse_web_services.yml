description: The following analytic detects a suspicious process making DNS queries
  to known, abused text-paste web services, VoIP, instant messaging, and digital distribution
  platforms. It leverages Sysmon EventID 22 logs to identify queries from processes
  like cmd.exe, powershell.exe, and others. This activity is significant as it may
  indicate an attempt to download malicious files, a common initial access technique.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration,
  or further compromise of the target host.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*pastebin*", "*discord*", "*api.telegram*","*t.me*")
  process_name IN ("cmd.exe", "*powershell*", "pwsh.exe", "wscript.exe","cscript.exe")
  OR Image IN ("*\\users\\public\\*", "*\\programdata\\*", "*\\temp\\*", "*\\Windows\\Tasks\\*",
  "*\\appdata\\*", "*\\perflogs\\*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by answer answer_count dvc process_exec process_guid process_name query
  query_count reply_code_id signature signature_id src user_id vendor_product QueryName
  QueryResults QueryStatus | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_process_dns_query_known_abuse_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection relies on sysmon logs with the Event ID 22, DNS Query.
  We suggest you run this detection at least once a day over the last 14 days.
known_false_positives: Noise and false positive can be seen if the following instant
  messaging is allowed to use within corporate network. In this case, a filter is
  needed.
