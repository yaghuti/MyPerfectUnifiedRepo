description: |
  This analytic identifies Snort intrusion signatures that have been triggered by ten or more distinct internal IP addresses within a one-hour window. It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs and focuses on the IntrusionEvent event type to detect activity that may indicate broad targeting or mass exploitation attempts. This behavior is often associated with opportunistic scanning, worm propagation, or automated exploitation of known vulnerabilities across multiple systems. If confirmed malicious, this could represent the early phase of a coordinated attack aiming to gain a foothold on several hosts or move laterally across the environment.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Logs, which
  includes the IntrusionEvent EventType. This search uses an input macro named `cisco_secure_firewall`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Security Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404).
  The intrusion access policy must also be configured.
known_false_positives: False positives should be minimal. Simultaneous vulnerability scanning across multiple internal hosts might trigger this, as well as some snort rules that are noisy. Disable those if necessary or increase the threshold.
