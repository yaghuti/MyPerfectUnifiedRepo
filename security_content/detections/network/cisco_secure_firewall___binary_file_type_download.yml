description: |
  The following analytic detects file downloads involving executable, archive, or scripting-related file types that are commonly used in malware delivery. 
  These file types include formats like PE executables, shell scripts, autorun files, installers, and known testing samples such as EICAR.
  This detection leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs and enriches the results using a filetype lookup to provide context.
  If confirmed malicious, these downloads could indicate the initial infection vector, malware staging, or scripting abuse.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Logs, which
  includes the FileEvent EventType. This search uses an input macro named `cisco_secure_firewall`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Security Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404).
  The malware & file access policy must also enable logging.
known_false_positives: IT admins or developers may legitimately download executables or scripts as part of their normal workflow. Apply additional filters accordingly.
