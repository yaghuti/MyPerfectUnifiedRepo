description: |
  The following analytic detects file transfers flagged as malware that occurred over non-standard ports (other than 80 and 443). Adversaries may attempt to bypass protocol-based detection or use alternate ports to blend in with other traffic. This analytic identifies these non-conventional flows and surfaces potential evasion techniques. If confirmed malicious this indicate potential malware delivery or other nefarious activity.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Logs, which
  includes the FileEvent EventType. This search uses an input macro named `cisco_secure_firewall`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Security Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404).
  The malware & file access policy must also enable logging.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate applications may download files over custom ports (e.g., CDN mirrors, APIs). Apply additional filters accordingly.
