description: |
  This analytic detects Lumma Stealer activity using Cisco Secure Firewall Intrusion Events. 
  It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense IntrusionEvent logs to identify cases where four of the following Snort signature IDs 64793, 64794, 64797, 64798, 64799, 64800, 64801, 62709, 64167, 64168, 64169, 64796, 62710, 62711, 62712, 62713, 62714, 62715, 62716, 62717, 64812, 64810, 64811 occurs in the span of 15 minutes from the same host.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior is highly indicative of a successful infection of Lumma Stealer.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Logs, which
  includes the IntrusionEvent EventType. This search uses an input macro named `cisco_secure_firewall`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Security Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404).
  The intrusion access policy must also be configured.
known_false_positives: False positives should be very unlikely.
