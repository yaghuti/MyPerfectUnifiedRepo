name: Cisco Secure Firewall - Veeam CVE-2023-27532 Exploitation Activity

description: |
  This analytic detects exploitation activity of CVE-2023-27532 using Cisco Secure Firewall Intrusion Events. 
  It leverages Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense IntrusionEvent logs to identify cases where Snort signature 61514 (Veeam Backup and Replication credential dump attempt) 
  is followed within a 5-minute window by 64795 (Veeam Backup and Replication xp_cmdshell invocation attempt), which detects the use of `xp_cmdshell`, a common post-exploitation technique. 
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior is highly indicative of a successful exploitation of CVE-2023-27532, followed by remote command execution or credential dumping.

how_to_implement: |
  This search requires Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Logs, which
  includes the IntrusionEvent EventType. This search uses an input macro named `cisco_secure_firewall`.
  We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations
  (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense logs. Replace the macro definition
  with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter
  macro designed to filter out known false positives.
  The logs are to be ingested using the Splunk Add-on for Cisco Security Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404).
  The intrusion access policy must also be configured.
known_false_positives: False positives should be very unlikely.
