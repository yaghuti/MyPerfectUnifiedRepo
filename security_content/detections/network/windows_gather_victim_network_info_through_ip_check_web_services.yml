type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects processes attempting to connect to 
  known IP check web services. This behavior is identified using Sysmon 
  EventCode 22 logs, specifically monitoring DNS queries to services like 
  "wtfismyip.com" and "ipinfo.io". This activity is significant as it is 
  commonly used by malware, such as Trickbot, for reconnaissance to determine 
  the infected machine's IP address. If confirmed malicious, this could allow 
  attackers to gather network information, aiding in further attacks or lateral 
  movement within the network.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 22
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22  QueryName IN ("*wtfismyip.com", "*checkip.*", "*ipecho.net",
  "*ipinfo.io", "*api.ipify.org", "*icanhazip.com", "*ip.anysrc.com","*api.ip.sb",
  "ident.me", "www.myexternalip.com", "*zen.spamhaus.org", "*cbl.abuseat.org", "*b.barracudacentral.org",
  "*dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net", "*spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net", "*iplogger.org*", "*ip-api.com*",
  "*geoip.*", "*icanhazip.*", "*ipwho.is*", "*ifconfig.me*", "*myip.com*", "*ipstack.com*",
  "*myexternalip.com*", "*ip-api.io*", "*trackip.net*", "*ipgeolocation.io*", "*ipfind.io*",
  "*freegeoip.app*", "*ipv4bot.whatismyipaddress.com*") |  stats  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime count by answer answer_count dvc process_exec process_guid
  process_name query query_count reply_code_id signature signature_id src user_id
  vendor_product QueryName QueryResults QueryStatus | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_gather_victim_network_info_through_ip_check_web_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be 
  ingesting logs with the process name, dns query name process path , and query 
  ststus from your endpoints like EventCode 22. If you are using Sysmon, you 
  must have at least version 12 of the Sysmon TA.

  positive of this detection.
