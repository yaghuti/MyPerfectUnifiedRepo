description: The following analytic identifies allowed network traffic to The 
  Onion Router (TOR), an anonymity network often exploited for malicious 
  activities. It leverages data from Next Generation Firewalls, using the 
  Network_Traffic data model to detect traffic where the application is TOR and 
  the action is allowed. This activity is significant as TOR can be used to 
  bypass conventional monitoring, facilitating hacking, data breaches, and 
  illicit content dissemination. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to 
  unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and severe compliance violations, 
  compromising the integrity and security of the network.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Network_Traffic where All_Traffic.app=tor AND All_Traffic.action

how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest 
  data from Next Generation Firewalls like, Cisco Secure Firewall Threat 
  Defense, Palo Alto Networks Firewalls or other network control devices that 
  mediate the traffic allowed into an environment. This is necessary so that the
  search can identify an 'action' taken on the traffic of interest. The search 
  requires the Network_Traffic data model to be populated.
