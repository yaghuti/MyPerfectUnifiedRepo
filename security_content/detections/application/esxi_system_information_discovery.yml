description: This detection identifies the use of ESXCLI system-level commands that retrieve 
  configuration details. While used for legitimate administration, this behavior may also 
  indicate adversary reconnaissance aimed at profiling the ESXi host's capabilities, 
  build information, or system role in preparation for further compromise.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog

how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Administrators may use this command when troubleshooting. Tune as needed.
