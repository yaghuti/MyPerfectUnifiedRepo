description: This detection looks for reverse shell string patterns on an ESXi 
  host, which may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to establish 
  remote control over the system.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message IN ("*bash -i >&*","*/dev/tcp/*","*/dev/udp/*",
  "*/socat exec:*","*socket(S,PF_INET*") OR (Message="*python -c*" AND Message="*import socket*")
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]+)\s"
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest Message 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `esxi_reverse_shell_patterns_filter`'
how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed.
