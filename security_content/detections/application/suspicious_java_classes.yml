description: The following analytic identifies suspicious Java classes often used
  for remote command execution exploits in Java frameworks like Apache Struts. It
  detects this activity by analyzing HTTP POST requests with specific content patterns
  using Splunk's `stream_http` data source. This behavior is significant because it
  may indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications, potentially
  leading to unauthorized remote code execution. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to data
  breaches, system compromise, and further network infiltration.
data_source: []
search: '`stream_http` http_method=POST http_content_length>1 | regex form_data="(?i)java\.lang\.(?:runtime|processbuilder)"
  | rename src_ip as src | stats count earliest(_time) as firstTime, latest(_time)
  as lastTime, values(url) as uri, values(status) as status, values(http_user_agent)
  as http_user_agent by src, dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `suspicious_java_classes_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from your web-traffic appliances that serve or sit in the path of your Struts application
  servers. This can be accomplished by indexing data from a web proxy, or by using
  network traffic-analysis tools, such as Splunk Stream or Bro.
known_false_positives: There are no known false positives.
