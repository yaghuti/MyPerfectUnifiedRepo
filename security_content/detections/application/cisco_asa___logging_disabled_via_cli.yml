description: |
  This analytic detects the disabling of logging functionality on a Cisco ASA device
  through CLI commands. Adversaries or malicious insiders may attempt to disable logging
  to evade detection and hide malicious activity. The detection looks for specific ASA
  syslog message IDs (111009, 111010, 111008) associated with command execution,
  combined with suspicious commands such as `no logging`, `logging disable`,
  `clear logging`, or `no logging host`. Disabling logging on a firewall or security device
  is a strong indicator of defense evasion.

how_to_implement: |
    This search requires Cisco ASA syslog data to be ingested into Splunk via the Cisco Security Cloud TA. To ensure this detection works effectively, configure your ASA and FTD devices to generate and forward both debug and informational level syslog messages before they are sent to Splunk. This analytic is designed to be used with comprehensive logging enabled, as it relies on the presence of specific message IDs. You can find specific instructions on how to set this up here : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/pix-500-series-security-appliances/63884-config-asa-00.html#toc-hId--1451069880. 
known_false_positives: |
  Administrators may intentionally disable or modify logging during maintenance,
  troubleshooting, or device reconfiguration. These events should be verified
  against approved change management activities.
