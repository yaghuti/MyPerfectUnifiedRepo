description: This detection identifies the use of ESXCLI commands to discover virtual machines on an ESXi host
  While used by administrators, this activity may also indicate adversary reconnaissance aimed at identifying 
  high value targets, mapping the virtual environment, or preparing for data theft or destructive operations.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message="*esxcli vm process*" Message="*list*"
  | rex field=_raw "\]: \[(?<user>\w+)\]:(?<command>.+)"
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]+)\s"

  | `esxi_vm_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Administrators may use this command when troubleshooting. Tune as needed.
