description: This detection identifies when the ESXi Shell is enabled on a host, which may indicate 
  that a malicious actor is preparing to execute commands locally or establish persistent access. 
  Enabling the shell outside of approved maintenance windows can be a sign of compromise or 
  unauthorized administrative activity.

how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed. Some Administrators may enable this for troubleshooting.
