description: This detection identifies access to sensitive system and configuration files 
  on an ESXi host, including authentication data, service configurations, and VMware-specific 
  management settings. Interaction with these files may indicate adversary reconnaissance,
  credential harvesting, or preparation for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or persistence.

how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Administrators may access these files for initial setup or troubleshooting. Limited
  in most environments. Tune as needed.
