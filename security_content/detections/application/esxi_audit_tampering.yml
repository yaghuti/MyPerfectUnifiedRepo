description: This detection identifies the use of the esxcli system auditrecords commands, 
  which can be used to tamper with logging on an ESXi host. This action may indicate an attempt 
  to evade detection or hinder forensic analysis by preventing the recording of system-level audit events.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message="*esxcli system auditrecords*" Message IN ("*remote*","*local*") NOT Message = "*[shell*"
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]+)\s"
  | rex field=_raw "[\w+]\]: (?<full_command>.*)"
  | rex field=full_command "\[(?<user>.*)]:\s(?<command>.*)"

how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed.
