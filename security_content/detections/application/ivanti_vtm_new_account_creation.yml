type: TTP
status: production
description: This analytic detects potential exploitation of the Ivanti Virtual Traffic
  Manager (vTM) authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-7593) to create new
  administrator accounts. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers
  to bypass authentication on the admin panel and create new admin users. This detection
  looks for suspicious new account creation events in the Ivanti vTM audit logs that
  lack expected authentication details, which may indicate exploitation attempts.
search: '`ivanti_vtm_audit` OPERATION="adduser" MODGROUP="admin" IP="!!ABSENT!!" |
  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by IP, MODUSER, OPERATION,
  MODGROUP, AUTH | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `ivanti_vtm_new_account_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this detection, ensure that Ivanti vTM audit logs are
  being ingested into Splunk. Configure the Ivanti vTM to send its audit logs to Splunk
  via syslog or by monitoring the log files directly. The sourcetype should be set
  to "ivanti_vtm_audit" or a similar custom sourcetype for these logs.
known_false_positives: Legitimate new account creation by authorized administrators
  will generate similar log entries. However, those should include proper authentication
  details. Verify any detected events against expected administrative activities and
  authorized user lists.
