description: This detection identifies SSH being enabled on ESXi hosts, which can be an early indicator of 
  malicious activity. Threat actors often use SSH to gain persistent remote access after compromising credentials
  or exploiting vulnerabilities.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message="*SSH access has been enabled"
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]+)\s"
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest Message 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `esxi_ssh_enabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed. Some Administrators may use SSH for troubleshooting.
