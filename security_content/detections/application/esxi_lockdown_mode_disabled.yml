description: This detection identifies when Lockdown Mode is disabled on an ESXi host, 
  which can indicate that a threat actor is attempting to weaken host security controls. 
  Disabling Lockdown Mode allows broader remote access via SSH or the host client and 
  may precede further malicious actions such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, 
  or VM tampering.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message IN ("*lockdownmode.disabled*", "*Administrator access to the host has been enabled*")
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]+)\s"
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest Message
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `esxi_lockdown_mode_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed.
