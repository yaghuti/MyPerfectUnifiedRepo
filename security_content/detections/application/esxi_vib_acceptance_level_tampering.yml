description: This detection identifies changes to the VIB (vSphere Installation Bundle) acceptance 
  level on an ESXi host. Modifying the acceptance level, such as setting it to CommunitySupported, 
  lowers the system's integrity enforcement and may allow the installation of unsigned or unverified software.

how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Administrators may use this command when installing third party VIBs. Tune as needed.
