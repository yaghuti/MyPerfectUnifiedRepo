description: The following analytic detects the creation of a new API token within
  an Okta tenant. It uses OktaIm2 logs ingested via the Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity
  Cloud to identify events where the `system.api_token.create` command is executed.
  This activity is significant because creating a new API token can indicate potential
  account takeover attempts or unauthorized access, allowing an adversary to maintain
  persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to execute API
  calls, access sensitive data, and perform administrative actions within the Okta
  environment.

how_to_implement: The analytic leverages Okta OktaIm2 logs to be ingested using the
  Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune Okta and tune the analytic
  to ensure proper fidelity. Modify risk score as needed.
