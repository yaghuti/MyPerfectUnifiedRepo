description: This detection identifies failed file download attempts on ESXi hosts by looking 
  for specific error messages in the system logs. These failures may indicate unauthorized 
  or malicious attempts to install or update componentsâ€”such as VIBs or scripts
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message IN ("*Download failed*", "*Failed to download file*",
  "*File download error*", "*Could not download*")
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]*)\s"
  | stats min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime count by dest Message 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `esxi_download_errors_filter` '
how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed.
