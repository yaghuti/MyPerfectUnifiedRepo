description: This detection identifies changes to the syslog configuration on an ESXi host using esxcli,
   which may indicate an attempt to disrupt log collection and evade detection.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message="*syslog config set*" AND Message="*esxcli*"
  | rex field=_raw "\].*\[\s*(?P<user>[^\]]+)\]:\s(?P<command>.+)"
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]+)\s"

  | `esxi_syslog_config_change_filter`'
how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed
