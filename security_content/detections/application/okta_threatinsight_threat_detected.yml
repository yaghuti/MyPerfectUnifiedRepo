description: The following analytic identifies threats detected by Okta ThreatInsight,
  such as password spraying, login failures, and high counts of unknown user login
  attempts. It leverages Okta Identity Management logs, specifically focusing on security.threat.detected
  events. This activity is significant for a SOC as it highlights potential unauthorized
  access attempts and credential-based attacks. If confirmed malicious, these activities
  could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and further exploitation of compromised
  accounts, posing a significant risk to the organization's security posture.

  | `okta_threatinsight_threat_detected_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection utilizes logs from Okta Identity Management (IM)
  environments. It requires the ingestion of OktaIm2 logs through the Splunk Add-on
  for Okta Identity Cloud (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6553).
known_false_positives: False positives may occur. It is recommended to fine-tune Okta
  settings and the analytic to ensure high fidelity. Adjust the risk score as necessary.
