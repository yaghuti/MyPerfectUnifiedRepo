description: This detection identifies when all virtual machines on an ESXi host are abruptly 
  terminated, which may indicate malicious activity such as a deliberate denial-of-service, 
  ransomware staging, or an attempt to destroy critical workloads.

how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed.
