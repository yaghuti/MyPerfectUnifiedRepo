description: This detection identifies when a user is granted the Administrator role on an ESXi host. 
  Assigning elevated privileges is a critical action that can indicate potential malicious behavior 
  if performed unexpectedly. Adversaries who gain access may use this to escalate privileges, 
  maintain persistence, or disable security controls.

how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments after initial setup, however tune
  as needed.
