description: This detection identifies when the ESXi firewall is disabled or set to 
  permissive mode, which can expose the host to unauthorized access and network-based 
  attacks. Such changes are often a precursor to lateral movement, data exfiltration, 
  or the installation of malicious software by a threat actor.
data_source:
- VMWare ESXi Syslog
search: '`esxi_syslog` Message="*network firewall set*" AND Message="*enabled f*"
  | rex field=_raw "Z (?<dest>[\w\.]+)\s"

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `esxi_firewall_disabled_filter`'
how_to_implement: This is based on syslog data generated by VMware ESXi hosts. To implement this search, 
  you must configure your ESXi systems to forward syslog output to your Splunk deployment. These logs must 
  be ingested with the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs, which provides field
  extractions and CIM compatibility. 
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed.
