description: "Detect a renamed instance of procdump.exe dumping the lsass process.
  This query looks for both -mm and -ma usage. -mm will produce a mini dump file and
  -ma will write a dump file with all process memory. Both are highly suspect and
  should be reviewed. Modify the query as needed.\nDuring triage, confirm this is
  procdump.exe executing. If it is the first time a Sysinternals utility has been
  ran, it is possible there will be a -accepteula on the command line. Review other
  endpoint data sources for cross process (injection) into lsass.exe."
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 1
search: '`sysmon` OriginalFileName=procdump  process_name!=procdump*.exe  EventID=1
  (CommandLine=*-ma* OR CommandLine=*-mm*) CommandLine=*lsass* |  stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by dest, parent_process_name, process_name,
  OriginalFileName, CommandLine | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `dump_lsass_via_procdump_rename_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: None identified.
