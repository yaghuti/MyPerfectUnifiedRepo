description: The following analytic has been deprecated in favour of a more generic
  approach. The following analytic identifies instances where Microsoft Excel spawns
  Windows Script Host processes (`cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe`). This behavior is
  detected using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process
  creation events where the parent process is `excel.exe`. This activity is significant
  because it is uncommon and often associated with malicious actions, such as spearphishing
  attacks. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute scripts,
  potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.
  Immediate investigation and mitigation are recommended.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, but if any are present,
  filter as needed. In some instances, `cscript.exe` is used for legitimate business
  practices.
