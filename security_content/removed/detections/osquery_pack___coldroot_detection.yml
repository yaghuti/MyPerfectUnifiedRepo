description: This search looks for ColdRoot events from the osx-attacks osquery pack.
data_source: []
search: '| from datamodel Alerts.Alerts | search app=osquery:results (name=pack_osx-attacks_OSX_ColdRoot_RAT_Launchd
  OR name=pack_osx-attacks_OSX_ColdRoot_RAT_Files) | rename columns.path as path |
  bucket _time span=30s | stats count(path) by _time, host, user, path | `osquery_pack___coldroot_detection_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data
  from your osquery deployed agents with the 
  [osx-attacks.conf](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/experimental/packs/osx-attacks.conf#L599)
  pack enabled. Also the [TA-OSquery](https://github.com/d1vious/TA-osquery) must
  be deployed across your indexers and universal forwarders in order to have the osquery
  data populate the Alerts data model
known_false_positives: There are no known false positives.
