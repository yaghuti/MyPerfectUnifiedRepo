description: The following analytic has been deprecated in favour of a more generic
  approach in "Windows Office Product Spawned Uncommon Process". The following analytic
  detects any Windows Office Product spawning `bitsadmin.exe`, a behavior often associated
  with malware families like TA551 and IcedID. This detection leverages data from
  Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and parent process
  relationships. This activity is significant because `bitsadmin.exe` is commonly
  used for malicious file transfers, potentially indicating a malware infection. If
  confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to download additional
  payloads, escalate privileges, or establish persistence, leading to further compromise
  of the affected system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.
