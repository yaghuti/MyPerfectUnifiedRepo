description: This search will detect DNS requests resolved by unauthorized DNS servers.
  Legitimate DNS servers should be identified in the Enterprise Security Assets and
  Identity Framework.
data_source: []
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count from datamodel=Network_Resolution
  where DNS.dest_category != dns_server AND DNS.src_category != dns_server by DNS.src
  DNS.dest | `drop_dm_object_name("DNS")` | `dns_query_requests_resolved_by_unauthorized_dns_servers_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you will need to ensure that
  DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. It also requires that
  your DNS servers are identified correctly in the Assets and Identity table of Enterprise
  Security.
known_false_positives: Legitimate DNS activity can be detected in this search. Investigate,
  verify and update the list of authorized DNS servers as appropriate.
