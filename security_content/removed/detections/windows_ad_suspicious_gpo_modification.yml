description: This analytic looks for a the creation of potentially harmful GPO which
  could lead to persistence or code execution on remote hosts. Note, this analyic
  is looking for the absence of the corresponding 5136 events which is evidence of
  the GPOs being manually edited (using a tool like PowerView) or potentially missing
  logs.

how_to_implement: Ingest EventCodes 5145 and 5136 from domain controllers. Additional
  SACLs required to capture EventCode 5136, see references for further information
  on how to configure this. The Group Policy - Audit Detailed File Share will need
  to be enabled on the DCs to generate event code 5145, this event is very noisy on
  DCs, consider tuning out sysvol events which do not match access mask 0x2.
known_false_positives: When a GPO is manually edited and 5136 events are not logging
  to Splunk.
