description: '**DEPRECATION NOTE** - This search has been deprecated and replaced
  with `Okta Multiple Accounts Locked Out`. The following anomaly will generate based
  on account lockout events utilizing Okta eventTypes of user.account.lock.limit or
  user.account.lock. Per the Okta docs site, this event is fired when a user account
  has reached the lockout limit. The account will not auto-unlock and a user or client
  cannot gain access to the account. This event indicates an account that will not
  be able to log in until remedial action is taken by the account admin. This event
  can be used to understand the specifics of an account lockout. Often this indicates
  a client application that is repeatedly attempting to authenticate with invalid
  credentials such as an old password.'

  as state, client.geographicalContext.city as city | stats count min(_time) as firstTime

how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: None. Account lockouts should be followed up on to determine
  if the actual user was the one who caused the lockout, or if it was an unauthorized
  actor.
