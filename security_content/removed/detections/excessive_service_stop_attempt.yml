description: The following analytic has been deprecated.
  The following analytic detects multiple attempts to stop or delete services
  on a system using `net.exe`, `sc.exe`, or `net1.exe`. It leverages Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names and command-line executions
  within a one-minute window. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary
  attempting to disable security or critical services to evade detection and further
  their objectives. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the attacker gaining
  persistence, escalating privileges, or disrupting essential services, thereby compromising
  the system's security posture.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
