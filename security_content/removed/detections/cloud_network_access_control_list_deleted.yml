description: Enforcing network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms
  used by cloud administrators to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker
  has gained control of the console by compromising an admin account, they can delete
  a network ACL and gain access to the instance from anywhere. This search will query
  the Change datamodel to detect users deleting network ACLs. Deprecated because it's
  a duplicate
data_source: []
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=DeleteNetworkAcl|rename userIdentity.arn as arn  |
  stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(errorMessage)
  values(errorCode) values(userAgent) values(userIdentity.*) by src userName arn eventName
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `cloud_network_access_control_list_deleted_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud
  provider. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing
  the `cloud_network_access_control_list_deleted_filter` macro.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a user has legitimately deleted a network
  ACL.
