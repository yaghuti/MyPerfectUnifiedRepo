description: The following analytic has been deprecated. The following analytic detects
  attempts to stop security-related services on an endpoint, which may indicate malicious
  activity. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, specifically
  searching for processes involving the "sc.exe" command with the "stop" parameter.
  This activity is significant because disabling security services can undermine the
  organization's security posture, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data
  exfiltration, or further attacks like malware installation or privilege escalation.
  If confirmed malicious, this behavior could compromise the endpoint and the entire
  network, necessitating immediate investigation and response.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: None identified. Attempts to disable security-related services
  should be identified and understood.
