description: This analytic has been deprecated in favor of "Windows CertUtil Download".
  The following analytic detects the use of certutil.exe to download files
  using the `-urlcache` and `-f` arguments. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) data, focusing on command-line executions that include these specific arguments.
  This activity is significant because certutil.exe is typically used for certificate
  services, and its use to download files from remote locations is uncommon and potentially
  malicious. If confirmed, this behavior could indicate an attempt to download and
  execute malicious payloads, leading to potential system compromise and unauthorized
  data access.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed based on parent-child relationship or network connection.
