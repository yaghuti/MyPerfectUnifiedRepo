  with this detection `Okta Unauthorized Access to Application - DM`.  The following
  anomaly identifies failed Okta SSO events utilizing the legacy Okta event "unauth
  app access attempt".'
data_source: []
search: '`okta` eventType=app.generic.unauth_app_access_attempt | stats min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(app) as Apps count by src_user, result
  ,displayMessage, src_ip | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `okta_failed_sso_attempts_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs are being
  ingested in your Splunk deployment.
known_false_positives: There may be a faulty config preventing legitmate users from
  accessing apps they should have access to.
