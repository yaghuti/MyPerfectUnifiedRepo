description: The following analytic has been deprecated. The following analytic identifies
  office documents executing macro code. It leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to detect
  when processes like WINWORD.EXE or EXCEL.EXE load specific DLLs associated with
  macros (e.g., VBE7.DLL). This activity is significant because macros are a common
  attack vector for delivering malicious payloads, such as malware. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise
  of the system. Disabling macros by default is recommended to mitigate this risk.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 7
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7 process_name IN ("WINWORD.EXE", "EXCEL.EXE", "POWERPNT.EXE","onenote.exe","onenotem.exe","onenoteviewer.exe","onenoteim.exe","msaccess.exe")
  loaded_file_path IN ("*\\VBE7INTL.DLL","*\\VBE7.DLL", "*\\VBEUI.DLL") | fillnull
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventID FileVersion
  Guid Hashes Image ImageLoaded MD5 Opcode OriginalFileName ProcessGuid ProcessID
  ProcessId SHA256 SecurityID Signature SignatureStatus Signed UserID dest loaded_file
  loaded_file_path original_file_name process_exec process_guid process_hash process_id
  process_name process_path service_dll_signature_exists service_dll_signature_verified
  signature signature_id user_id vendor_product | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `office_document_executing_macro_code_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and ImageLoaded (Like sysmon EventCode 7) from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Also be sure to include those monitored dll to your own sysmon config.
known_false_positives: False positives may occur if legitimate office documents are
  executing macro code. Ensure to investigate the macro code and the command to be
  executed. If the macro code is benign, add the document name to the exclusion list.
  Some applications may legitimately load VBE7INTL.DLL, VBE7.DLL, or VBEUI.DLL.
