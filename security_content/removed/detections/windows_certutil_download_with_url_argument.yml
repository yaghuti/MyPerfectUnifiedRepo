description: This analytic has been deprecated in favor of "Windows CertUtil Download".
  The following analytic detects the use of `certutil.exe` to download
  files using the `-URL` arguments. This behavior is identified by monitoring command-line
  executions for these specific arguments via Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  telemetry. This activity is significant because `certutil.exe` is a legitimate tool
  often abused by attackers to download and execute malicious payloads. If confirmed
  malicious, this could allow an attacker to download and execute arbitrary files,
  potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise
  of the system.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed based on parent-child relationship or network connection.
