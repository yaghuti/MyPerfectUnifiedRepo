description: This search looks for PowerShell processes started with a base64 encoded
  command-line passed to it, with parameters to modify the execution policy for the
  process, and those that prevent the display of an interactive prompt to the user.
  This combination of command-line options is suspicious because it overrides the
  default PowerShell execution policy, attempts to hide itself from the user, and
  passes an encoded script to be run on the command-line. Deprecated because almost
  the same as Malicious PowerShell Process - Encoded Command

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Legitimate process can have this combination of command-line
  options, but it's not common.
