description: The following analytic has been deprecated. The following analytic detects
  the use of `reg.exe` to export Windows Registry hives, which may contain sensitive
  credentials. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving `save` or `export` actions
  targeting the `sam`, `system`, or `security` hives. This activity is significant
  as it indicates potential offline credential access attacks, often executed from
  untrusted processes or scripts. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain access
  to credential data, enabling further compromise and lateral movement within the
  network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: It is possible some agent based products will generate false
  positives. Filter as needed.
