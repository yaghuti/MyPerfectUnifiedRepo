description: The following analytic has been deprecated in favour of a more generic
  approach in "Windows Office Product Spawned Uncommon Process". The following analytic
  detects an Office product spawning WScript.exe or CScript.exe. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation
  events where Office applications are the parent processes. This activity is significant
  because it may indicate the execution of potentially malicious scripts through Office
  products, a common tactic in phishing attacks and malware delivery. If confirmed
  malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration,
  or further system compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on macro based approved
  documents in the organization. Filtering may be needed.
