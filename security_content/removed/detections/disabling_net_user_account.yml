description: The following analytic has been deprecated.
  The following analytic detects the use of the `net.exe` utility to disable
  a user account via the command line. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary's attempt to disrupt
  user availability, potentially as a precursor to further malicious actions. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to denial of service for legitimate users, aiding the
  attacker in maintaining control or covering their tracks.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
