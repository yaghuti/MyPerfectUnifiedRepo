description: The following analytic has been deprecated. The following analytic detects
  suspicious registry modifications that change the default file association to execute
  a malicious payload. It leverages data from the Endpoint data model, specifically
  monitoring registry paths under "*\\shell\\open\\command\\*" and "*HKCR\\*". This
  activity is significant because altering default file associations can allow attackers
  to execute arbitrary scripts or payloads when a user opens a file, leading to potential
  code execution. If confirmed malicious, this technique can enable attackers to persist
  on the compromised host and execute further malicious commands, posing a severe
  threat to the environment.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
