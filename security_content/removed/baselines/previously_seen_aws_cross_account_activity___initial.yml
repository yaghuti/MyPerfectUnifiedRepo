description: This search looks for **AssumeRole** events where the requesting account
  differs from the requested account, then writes these relationships to a lookup
  file.
search: '| tstats earliest(_time) as firstTime latest(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Authentication
  where Authentication.signature=AssumeRole by Authentication.vendor_account Authentication.user

how_to_implement: You must install and configure the Splunk Add-on for AWS (version
  5.1.0 or later)and Enterprise Security 6.2, which contains the required updates
  to the Authentication data model for cloud use cases. Validate the user name entries
  in `previously_seen_aws_cross_account_activity.csv`, a lookup file created by this
  support search.
