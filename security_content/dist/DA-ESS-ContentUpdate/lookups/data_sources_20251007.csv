Deploy the Splunk Add-on for Cisco ASA (TA-cisco_asa) on indexers/heavy forwarders and the Cisco ASA App on search heads for best parsing, CIM mapping, and dashboards. This data is ingested via SYSLOG. You must be ingesting Cisco ASA syslog data into your Splunk environment. To ensure all detections work, configure your ASA and FTD devices to generate and forward both debug and informational level syslog messages before they are sent to Splunk. A few analytics are designed to be used with comprehensive logging enabled, as it relies on the presence of specific message IDs.

These events are generated when a package deployment operation begins, providing details about the package being deployed.

Event ID 400 is particularly significant for security monitoring as it includes information about whether the package has full trust privileges. Full trust packages run with elevated privileges outside the normal AppX container restrictions, allowing them to access system resources that regular AppX packages cannot.

Adversaries have been observed leveraging full trust MSIX packages to deliver malware, as documented in recent threat intelligence reports. Monitoring these events can help identify potentially malicious package installations that request elevated privileges.

These events are generated when an MSIX/AppX package has been successfully installed on a system.

Event ID 854 provides information about successful package installations, including the path to the installed package and the user who performed the installation. This data is valuable for security monitoring as it can help identify unauthorized or suspicious package installations.

While most package installations are legitimate, monitoring these events can help identify potentially malicious activity, especially when correlated with other events such as unsigned package installations (EventID 603 with Flags=8388608) or full trust package installations (EventID 400 with HasFullTrust=true).

Event ID 855 is particularly valuable for security monitoring as it confirms the successful installation of MSIX packages, including information about the package identifiers. This can help identify potentially malicious package installations in an environment.

Monitoring these events can help track MSIX package installations across an environment, which is important given that MSIX packages have been leveraged by threat actors such as FIN7, Zloader (Storm-0569), and FakeBat (Storm-1113) for malware delivery.

This data is valuable for security monitoring as it can help identify what MSIX packages users are attempting to open in an environment, which may help detect malicious MSIX packages before they're fully installed.

MSIX package abuse has been observed in various threat campaigns, including those from FIN7, Zloader (Storm-0569), and FakeBat (Storm-1113). Monitoring these interactions can provide early warning of potential MSIX package abuse.
