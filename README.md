# My Unified Security Repository

This repository is designed to unify and manage all security content, tools, and documentation in one place, enabling easy development, testing, and customization.

## Project Structure & Philosophy

This repository contains several main sections, each sourced from a different upstream project:

### 1. Content (`security_content`)
This folder includes a collection of detections, stories, macros, lookups, and other security files sourced from [splunk/security_content](https://github.com/splunk/security_content). This content forms the foundation for threat detection and analysis in Splunk.

### 2. Tool (`contentctl`)
This folder contains the management and build tool, sourced from [splunk/contentctl](https://github.com/splunk/contentctl). The `contentctl` tool is used for validating, building, and generating output from the security content.

### 3. Wiki (`security_content_wiki`)
This folder includes documentation and guides extracted from the wiki section of [splunk/security_content.wiki](https://github.com/splunk/security_content.wiki). Here you can find technical information, installation guides, development instructions, and content structure references.

## Output Generation

After installing the tool and preparing the content, you can use the `contentctl` tool to build the content. The final product will be generated in the `security_content/dist` folder, ready for use in Splunk.

## Development Goal

The main goal is to enable custom changes to the `contentctl` tool so that, during the build process, you can produce tailored outputs based on your own ideas and requirements. All sections are included as regular files, with no dependency on git history or submodules.
