## What is contentctl?
`contentctl` is a tool developed by the Splunk Threat Research Team to help with managing the content living in [splunk/security_content](https://github.com/splunk/security_content) and producing the Enterprise Security Content Update app for Splunk. While its development is largely driven by STRT's needs, it has been somewhat genericized and can be used by customers and partners to package their own content. Simply put, `contentctl` is the workhorse that packages detections, macros, lookups, dashboards into a Splunk app that you can use, and that understands the YAML structure and project layout we've selected to keep development clean.

## Quick Start Guide
Check out our [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md) to get started!

## Content Testing
Read more about how `contentctl` can help test and validate your content in a real Splunk instance [here](docs/ContentTestingGuide.md).

## Sample CICD Workflows
Already using `contentctl`, or looking to get started with it already configured in GitHub Actions? [Our guide](docs/Sample_CICD_Templates.md) includes workflows to help you build and test your app.
